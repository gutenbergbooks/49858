<i>On the Mixed Character of the Supernatural System,
or Theo-Mythology, of Homer.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Though the poems of Homer are replete, perhaps
beyond any others, with refined and often latent adaptations,
yet it may be observed in general of the modes
of representation used by him, that they are preeminently
the reverse of systematic. Institutions or characters,
which are in themselves consistent, probably
gain by this method of proceeding, provided the execution
be not unworthy of the design. For it secures
their exhibition in more, and more varied, points of
view, than can possibly be covered by the more didactic
process. But the possession of this advantage depends
upon the fact, that there is in them a harmony, which
is their base, and which we have only to discover.
Whereas, if that harmony be wanting, if in lieu of it
there be a groundwork of fundamental discrepancy,
then the conditions of effect are wholly changed. The
multiplied variety of view becomes a multiplication of
incongruity; each new aspect offers a new problem: and
the more masterly the hand of the artist, the more arduous
becomes the attempt to comprehend and present
in their mutual bearings the pictures he has drawn,
and the suggestions he has conveyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it has been with that which, following German
example, I have denominated the Theo-mythology of
Homer. By that term it seems not improper to designate
a mixture of theology and mythology, as these two
words are commonly understood. Theology I suppose to
mean, a system dealing with the knowledge of God
and the unseen world: mythology, a system conversant
with the inventions of man concerning them. In the
Homeric poems I find both of these largely displayed:
but with this difference, that the first was in visible decline,
the second in such rapid and prolific development,
that, while Homer is undoubtedly a witness to
older fable, which had already in his time become settled
tradition, he is also in this department himself
evidently and largely a Maker and Inventor, and the
material of the Greek mythology comes out of his
hands far more fully moulded, and far more diversified,
than it entered them.</p>

<p>Of the fact that the Homeric religion does not present
a consistent and homogeneous whole, we have
abundant evidence in the difficulties with which, so
soon as the literary age of Greece began, expositors
found themselves incumbered; and which drove them
sometimes upon allegory as a resource, sometimes, as

<p>I know not whether it has been owing to our somewhat
narrow jealousies concerning the function of Holy
Scripture, or to our want of faith in the extended
Providence of God, and His manifestations in the
world, or to the real incongruity in the evidence at our
command, or to any other cause, but the fact, at least,
seems to me beyond doubt, that our modes of dealing
with the Homeric poems in this cardinal respect have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
been eminently unsatisfactory. Those who have found
in Homer the elements of religious truth, have resorted
to the far-fetched and very extravagant supposition, that
he had learned them from the contemporary Hebrews,
or from the law of Moses. The more common and popular
opinion<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> has perhaps been one, which has put all such
elements almost or altogether out of view; one which
has treated the Immortals in Homer as so many impersonations
of the powers of nature, or else magnified
men, and their social life as in substance no more than
as a reflection of his picture of heroic life, only gilded
with embellishments, and enlarged in scale, in proportion
to the superior elevation of its sphere. Few,
comparatively, have been inclined to recognise in the
Homeric poems the vestiges of a real traditional knowledge,
derived from the epoch when the covenant of
God with man, and the promise of a Messiah, had not
yet fallen within the contracted forms of Judaism for
shelter, but entered more or less into the common consciousness,
and formed a part of the patrimony of the
human race<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>But surely there is nothing improbable in the supposition,
that in the poems of Homer such vestiges may
be found. Every recorded form of society bears some
traces of those by which it has been preceded: and in
that highly primitive form, which Homer has been the
instrument of embalming for all posterity, the law of
general reason obliges us to search for elements and
vestiges belonging to one more primitive still. And,
if we are to inquire in the Iliad and the Odyssey for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
what belongs to antecedent manners and ideas, on
what ground can it be pronounced improbable, that no
part of these earlier traditions should be old enough to
carry upon them the mark of belonging to the religion,
which the Book of Genesis represents as brought by
our first parents from Paradise, and as delivered by
them to their immediate descendants in general? The
Hebrew Chronology, considered in connection with the
probable date of Homer, would even render it difficult
or irrational to proceed upon any other supposition:
nor if, as by the Septuagint or otherwise, a larger period
is allowed for the growth of our race, will the state of
this case be materially altered. For the facts must
remain, that the form of society exhibited by Homer
was itself in many points essentially patriarchal, that it
contains, in matter not religious, such, for instance, as
the episode of the Cyclops, clear traces of a yet earlier
condition yet more significant of a relation to that
name, and that there is no broadly marked period of
human experience, or form of manners, which we can
place between the great trunk of human history in Holy
Scripture, and this famed Homeric branch, which of all
literary treasures appears to be its eldest born. Standing
next to the patriarchal histories of Holy Scripture,
why should it not bear, how can it not bear, traces of
the religion under which the patriarchs lived?</p>

<p>The immense longevity of the early generations of
mankind was eminently favourable to the preservation
of pristine traditions. Each individual, instead of being
as now a witness of, or an agent in, one or two transmissions
from father to son, would observe or share in
ten times as many. According to the Hebrew Chronology,
Lamech the father of Noah was of mature age
before Adam died: and Abraham was of mature age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
before Noah died. Original or early witnesses, remaining
so long as standards of appeal, would evidently
check the rapidity of the darkening and destroying
process.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that man now lived but twenty years,
instead of fourscore. Would not this greatly quicken
the waste of ancient traditions? And is not the converse
also true?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sufficiently proved from Holy Scripture.</i></div>

<p>Custom has made it with us second nature to take
for granted a broad line of demarcation between those
who live within the pale of Revelation, and the residue
of mankind. But Holy Scripture does not appear to
recognise such a severance in any manner, until we
come to the revelation of the Mosaic law, which was
like the erection of a temporary shelter for truths that
had ranged at large over the plain, and that were apparently
in danger of being totally absorbed in the
mass of human inventions. But before this vineyard
was planted, and likewise outside its fence, there were
remains, smaller or greater, of the knowledge of God;
and there was a recognised relation between Jehovah
and mankind, which has been the subject of record
from time to time, and the ground of acts involving
the admonition, or pardon, or correction, or destruction,
of individuals or communities.</p>

<p>The latest of these indications, such as the visit of the
Wise Men from the East, are not the most remarkable:
because first the captivity in Babylon, and subsequently
the dissemination of Jewish groups through so many
parts of the world, could not but lead to direct communications
of divine knowledge, at least, in some
small degree. From such causes, there would be many
a Cornelius before him who became the first-fruits of
the Gentiles. Yet even the interest, which probably
led to such communications from the Jew, must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
had its own root in relics of prior tradition, which
attested the common concern of mankind in Him that
was to come. But in earlier times, and when the Jewish
nation was more concentrated, and was certainly obscure,
the vestiges of extra-patriarchal and extra-judaical
relations between God and man are undeniable. They
have been traced with clearness and ability in a popular
treatise by the hand of Bishop Horsley<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>Let us take, for instance, that case of extreme wickedness,
which most severely tries the general proposition.
The punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah for
their sins was preceded by a declaration from the Most
High, importing a direct relation with those guilty
cities<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; and two angels, who had visited Abraham on the
plains of Mamre, ‘came to Sodom at even.’ Ruth the
Moabitess was an ancestress, through king David, of
our Lord. Rahab in Jericho, ‘by faith,’ as the Apostle
assures us, entertained the spies of the Israelites. Job,
living in a country where the worship of the sun was
practised, had, as had his friends, the knowledge of the
true God. Melchizedek, the priest of On, whose daughter
Joseph married, and Jethro, the father-in-law of
Moses, are other conspicuous instances. Later in time,
Nineveh, the great Assyrian capital, received the message
of the prophet Jonah, and repented at his preaching.
Here the teaching organ was supplied from among
the Jews: but Balaam exhibits to us the gift of inspiration
beyond their bounds. Once more; many centuries
after the Homeric manners had disappeared, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
during the captivity, we find not only a knowledge of
God, but dreams and signs vouchsafed to Assyrian kings,
and interpreted for them by the prophet Daniel. We
have, in short, mingling with the whole course of the
Old Testament, a stream of evidence which shows the
partial remnants of the knowledge of God, apart from
that main current of it which is particularly traced for
us in the patriarchal and Mosaic histories. Again,
many centuries after Homer, when all traces of primitive
manners had long vanished, still in the Prometheus
of Æschylus, and in the Pollio of Virgil, we have signs,
though I grant they are faint ones, that the celestial rays
had not even then ‘faded into the light of common day’
for the heathen world. It would really be strange, and
that in a high degree, if a record like that of Homer,
with so many resemblances to the earliest manners in
other points, had no link to connect it with them in
their most vital part.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The question one of history.</i></div>

<p>The general proposition, that we may expect to find
the relics of Scriptural traditions in the heroic age of
Greece, though it leads, if proved, to important practical
results, is independent even of a belief in those
traditions, as they stand in the scheme of revealed
truth. They must be admitted to have been facts on
earth, even by those who would deny them to be facts
of heavenly origin, in the shape in which Christendom
receives them: and the question immediately before us
is one of pure historical probability. The descent of
mankind from a single pair, the lapse of that pair from
original righteousness, are apart from and ulterior to it.
We have traced the Greek nation to a source, and along
a path of migration, which must in all likelihood have
placed its ancestry, at some point or points, in close
local relations with the scenes of the earliest Mosaic
records: the retentiveness of that people equalled its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
receptiveness, and its close and fond association with
the past made it prone indeed to incorporate novel
matter into its religion, but prone also to keep it there
after its incorporation.</p>

<p>If such traditions existed, and if the laws which
guide historical inquiry require or lead us to suppose
that the forefathers of the Greeks must have lived
within their circle, then the burden of proof must lie
not so properly with those who assert that the traces
of them are to be found in the earliest, that is, the
Homeric, form of the Greek mythology, as with those
who deny it. What became of those old traditions?
They must have decayed and disappeared, not by a
sudden process, but by a gradual accumulation of the
corrupt accretions, in which at length they were so
completely interred as to be invisible and inaccessible.
Some period therefore there must have been, at which
they would remain clearly perceptible, though in conjunction
with much corrupt matter. Such a period
might be made the subject of record, and if such there
were, we might naturally expect to find it in the oldest
known work of the ancient literature.</p>

<p>If the poems of Homer do, however, contain a picture,
even though a defaced picture, of the primeval
religious traditions, it is obvious that they afford a
most valuable collateral support to the credit of the
Holy Scripture, considered as a document of history.
Still we must not allow the desire of gaining this advantage
to bias the mind in an inquiry, which can only
be of value if it is conducted according to the strictest
rules of rational criticism.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Invention combined with tradition.</i></div>

<p>We may then, in accordance with those rules, be
prepared to expect that the Hellenic religion will prove
to have been in part constructed from traditional knowledge.
The question arises next, Of what other materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in addition was it composed? The answer can be but one;
Such materials would be supplied by invention. But invention
cannot absolutely create; it can only work upon
what it finds already provided to its hand. The provision
made in this instance was simply that with which
the experience of man supplied him. It was mediate or
immediate: mediate, where the Greek received matter
from abroad, and wrought upon it: immediate, where
he conceived it for himself. That experience lay in two
spheres&mdash;the sphere of external nature, and the sphere
of life. Each of these would afford for the purpose
the elements of Power, Grandeur, Pleasure, Beauty,
Utility; and such would be the elements suited to the
work of constructing or developing a system that was
to present objects for his worship. We may therefore
reasonably expect to find in the religion features referable
to these two departments for their origin;&mdash;first,
the powerful forces and attractive forms of outward
nature; secondly, the faculties and propensities of man,
and those relations to his fellow-men, amidst which his
lot is cast, and his character formed.</p>

<p>If this be so, then, in the result thus compounded
out of tradition purporting to be revealed, and out of
invention strictly human, we ought to recognise, so long
as both classes of ingredients are in effective coexistence,
not strictly a false theology, but a true theology
falsified: a true religion, into which falsehood has
entered, and in which it is gradually overlaying and
absorbing the original truth, until, when the process
has at length reached a certain point, it is wholly
hidden and borne down by countervailing forces, so
that the system has for practical purposes become a false
one, and both may and should be so termed and treated.</p>

<p>I admit that very different modes of representing the
case have been in vogue. Sometimes by those to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the interest of Christianity is precious, and sometimes
in indifference or hostility to its fortunes, it is held
that the basis of the Greek mythology is laid in the
deification of the powers of nature. The common assumptions
have been such as the following: That the
starting-point of the religion of the heroic age is to be
sought only in the facts of the world, in the ideas and
experience of man. That nature-worship, the deification
of elemental and other physical powers, was the
original and proper basis of the system. That this
system, presumably self-consistent, as having been
founded on a given principle, was broken up by the intervention
of theogonic revolutions. That the system, of
which Jupiter was at the head, was an imperfect reconstruction
of a scheme of divine rule out of the fragments
of an earlier religion, and that it supplanted the elder
gods. In short, the Greek mythology is represented
as a corrupt edition, not of original revealed religion,
but of a Nature-worship which, as it seems to be assumed,
was separated by a gulf never measured, and
never passed, from the primitive religious traditions of
our race. Further it seems to be held, that the faults
and imperfections of the pagan religion have their root
only in a radical inability of the human mind to produce
pure deity; that they do not represent the depravation
of an ancient and divine gift, but rather the
simple failure of man in a work of invention. Indeed,
we need not wonder that it should fail in a process
which, critically considered, can mean little else than
mere exaggeration of itself and from its own experience<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>,
and which must be so apt to become positive
caricature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The basis was not in Nature-worship.</i></div>

<p>Again, Dean Prideaux, in his Connection of Sacred
and Profane History, gives the following genesis of the
Greek mythology. From the beginning, he says, there
was a general notion among men, founded on a sense that
they were impure, of the necessity of a mediator with
God. There being no mediator clearly revealed, man
chose mediators for himself, and took the sun, moon,
and stars, as high intelligences well fitted for the purpose.
Hence we find Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Apollo,
Mercury, Venus, and Diana, to be first ranked in the
polytheism of the ancients: for they were their first
gods<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>This theory is not in correspondence with the facts
of the heroic age. There is no sense whatever of an
impurity disabling men from access to God; no clear
or general opinion of the necessity of mediation; no
glimpse even of a god superior to Jupiter and the rest
with whom they were on behalf of man to mediate.</p>

<p>And, again, the opinion, that the origin of the
religion lay in Nature-worship, has had the support
both of high and also of recent authorities. The
eminent and learned Dr. Döllinger, in his ‘Heidenthum
und Judenthum,’ says, that the deification of Nature, its
forces, or the particular objects it offered to the senses,
constituted the groundwork of the Greek, as well as of
the other heathen religions. The idea of God continued
to be powerful even when it had been darkened, and the
godhead was felt as present, and active everywhere in
the physical order. In working out his general rule
for each mythological deity in particular, this author conceives
the original form of their existence to have been
that of a Nature-power, even where the vestiges of such
a conception have, under subsequent handling, become
faint or imperceptible. Thus Juno, Minerva, Latona,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Diana, and others in succession, are referred to such an
origin<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>Now in dealing with this hypothesis, I would ask,
what then has become of the old Theistic and Messianic
traditions? and how has it happened they have
been amputated by a process so violent as to make
them to leave, even while the state of society continued
still primitive, no trace behind them? But further. I
would urge with confidence that the ample picture of
the religion of the heroic ages, as we have it in
Homer, which is strictly for this purpose in the nature
of a fact, cannot be made to harmonize with the hypothesis
which refers it to such a source. The proof
of this statement must depend mainly on the examination
which we have to institute in detail: but I am
anxious at once to bring it into view, and to refer
briefly to some of the grounds on which it rests, because
it is susceptible of demonstration by evidence as contradistinguished
from theory. On the other hand, when I
proceed farther, evidence and theory must of necessity be
mixed up together; and dissent from a particular mode
of tracing out the association between the traditional
and inventive elements of the system might unawares
betray the reader into the conclusion, that no such distinct
traditional elements were to be found, but that
all, or nearly all, was pure fable. I say, then, there is
much in the theo-mythology of Homer, which, if it had
been a system founded in fable, could not have appeared
there. It stands before us like one of our old
churches, having different parts of its fabric in the
different styles of architecture, each of which speaks
for itself, and which we know to belong to the several
epochs in the history of the art, when their characteristic
combinations were respectively in vogue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Nor is the system from invention only.</i></div>

<p>While on the one hand it has deities, such as Latona,
without any attributes at all, on the other hand,
we find in it both gods and goddesses, with an assemblage
of such attributes and functions as have no common
link by which invention could have fastened them
together. They are such, likewise, as to bring about
cross divisions and cross purposes, that the Greek force
of imagination, and the Greek love of symmetry, would
have alike eschewed. How could invention have set
up Pallas as the goddess at once of peace and its industries,
of wisdom, and of war? Its object would
clearly have been to impersonate attributes; and to
associate even distinct, much less conflicting attributes,
in the same deity, would have been simply to confuse
them. How again could it have combined in Apollo,
who likewise turns the courses of rivers by his might,
the offices of destruction, music, poetry, prophecy,
archery, and medicine? Again, if he is the god of
medicine, why have we Paieon? if of poetry, why have
we the Muses? If Minerva be (as she is) goddess of
war, why have we Mars? if of the work of the Artificer,
why have we also Vulcan? if of prudence and sagacity,
and even craft<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, why Mercury?</p>

<p>And again, the theory is, that the chief personages
of the mythology are representatives of the great
powers of the physical universe. I ask, therefore, how
it happens that in the Homeric, or, as we may call it,
primitive form of the system, these great powers of the
universe are for the most part very indistinctly and partially
personified, whereas we see in vivid life and constant
movement another set of figures, having either an
obscure or partial relation, or no relation at all, to those
powers? Such a state of the evidence surely strikes at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the very root of the hypothesis we are considering:
but it is the state of the evidence which we actually
find before us. Take for instance Time, Ocean, Earth,
Sun, Moon, Stars, Air; all these prime natural objects
and agents are either not personified at all in Homer,
or so indistinctly and mutely personified that they are
the mere zoophytes of his supernatural world, of which
the gorgeous life and brilliant movement are sustained
by a separate set of characters. Of these more effective
agents, some are such as it is impossible rationally
to set down for mere impersonations of ideas; while
others are plainly constituted as lords over, and not
beings derivative from, those powers or provinces of
nature, with which they are placed in special relations.
It cannot for instance rationally be said that the Homeric
Jupiter is a mere impersonation of the air which
he rules, or the Homeric Neptune of the sea, or the
Homeric Aidoneus (or Aides) of the nether world. For
to the first of these three, many functions are assigned
having no connection with the air. As for example, when
he gives swiftness of foot to Æneas on Mount Ida, that
he might escape the pursuit of Achilles<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. In the case of
the second, there is a rival figure, namely, Nereus, who
never that we know of leaves the sea, who is the father
of the Sea-nymphs, and who evidently fulfils the conditions
of Sea impersonated far better than does Neptune;
Neptune, who marched upon the battle-field in
Troas, and who, with Apollo, had himself built the
walls of Ilium. Besides all this, the sea, to which
Neptune belongs, is itself not one of the great elemental
powers of the universe, but is derived, like
rivers, springs, and wells, from Father Ocean, who fears
indeed the thunderbolt of Jupiter, but is not bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
attendance even in the great chapter of Olympus<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. As
to Aidoneus, he can hardly impersonate the nether
world, because in Homer he does not represent or govern
it, but only has to do with that portion of it, which
is inhabited by the souls of departed men. For, as far
beneath his realm as Earth is beneath Heaven, lies the
dark Tartarus of Homer, peopled with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span> and his
Titans. Nor, on the other hand, do we know that the
Elysian fields of the West were subject to his sway. The
elemental powers are in Homer, though not altogether,
yet almost altogether, extrinsic to his grand Olympian
system.</p>

<p>Without, then, anticipating this or that particular
result from the inquiry into the mode and proportions
in which traditional and inventive elements are combined
in the poems of Homer, it may safely be denied
that his picture of the supernatural world could have
been drawn by means of materials exclusively supplied
by invention from the sources of nature and experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Traditive origin of Sacrifice.</i></div>

<p>And indeed there is one particular with respect to
which the admission will be generally made, that the
Greek mythological system stood indebted at least to
a primitive tradition, if not to a direct command; I
mean the institution of sacrifice. This can hardly be
supposed to have been an original conception in every
country; and it distinctly points us to one common
source. Sacrifice was, according to Dr. Döllinger<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, an
inheritance which descended to the Greeks from the
pristine time before the division of the nations. Without
doubt the transmission of ritual, depending upon
outward action, is more easy than that of ideas. But
the fact that there was a transmission of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
proves that there was a channel for it, open and continuous:
and the circumstances might be such as to
allow of the passage of ideas, together with institutions,
along it.</p>

<p>It cannot be necessary to argue on the other side in
any detail in order to show, that for much of his supernatural
machinery, Homer was indebted to invention,
whether his own or that of generations, or nations, which
had preceded him. Had his system been one purely traditional
in its basis, had it only broken into many rays
the integral light of one God, it would have presented
to us no such deity as Juno, who is wholly without
prototype, either abstract or personal, in the primitive
system, and no such mere reflections of human passions
as are Mars and Venus: not to speak of those large additions,
which we are to consider as belonging not so
much to the basis and general outline of the system, as
to the later stages of its development.</p>

<p>Let us now endeavour to inquire what mental,
moral, and physical influences would be likely, in early
times, to give form and direction to that alterative
process, which the primitive ideas of religion, when
removed beyond the precinct of Revelation and the
knowledge of the Sacred Records, had to undergo.</p>

<p>This law of decline we may examine, first ideally,
according to the influences likely to operate on the
course of thought with respect to religion: and then
with reference to that which is specifically Greek, by
sketching in outline the actual mode of handling the
material at command, which resulted in the creation of
the Homeric or Olympian system. The first belongs
to the metaphysical genesis of the system: the second
to its historical formation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tendency of primitive religion to decay.</i></div>

<p>So long as either the Sacred Records, or the Light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which supplied them, remained within reach, there were
specific means either in operation, or at least accessible,
which, as far as their range extended, would serve to
check error, whether of practice or speculation, and to
clear up uncertainty, as the sundial verifies or corrects
the watch. But the stream darkened more and more,
as it got farther from the source. The Pagan religion
could boast of its unbroken traditions; like some forms
of Christianity, and like the government of France
until 1789. But its uninterrupted course was really
an uninterrupted aberration from the line of truth;
and to boast of the evenness of its motion was in
effect to boast of the deadness of the conscience of
mankind, which had not virtue enough even to disturb
progressive degeneracy by occasional reproach. In
later times, the Pagan system had its three aspects:
it was one thing for the populace, another for statesmen,
and a third for philosophers. But in Homer’s
time it had suffered no criticism and no analysis: the
human self-consciousness was scarcely awakened; introspection
had not begun its work. Imagination and
affection continually exercised their luxuriant energies
in enlarging and developing the system of preternatural
being and action. However copiously the element of
fiction, nay, of falsehood, entered into it, yet for the
masses of mankind it was still subjectively true<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>All was forward movement. Man had not, as it
were, had time to ask himself, is this a lie? or even,
whither does it tend? His soul, in those days of infancy,
never questioned, always believed. Logical
inconsistency, even moral solecism, did not repel it,
nor slacken the ardour of its energies in the work of
construction: construction of art, construction of man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>ners,
construction of polity, construction of religion.
This is what we see, in glowing heat, throughout the
poems of Homer, and it is perhaps the master key to
their highest interest. They show us, in the province we
are now considering, heroes earning their title to the
Olympian life, mute nature everywhere adjusting herself
to the scheme of supernatural impersonations, and
religion allied to the human imagination, as closely
as it was afterwards by Mahomet wedded to the sword.
Everywhere we see that which is properly called myth,
in the process of formation. Early mythology is the
simple result of the working of the human mind, in a
spirit of belief or of credulity, upon the material offered
to it by prior tradition, by the physical universe, by the
operations of the mind, and by the experience of life.</p>

<p>We may, as follows, accompany the vicious series
through which thought might probably be led, with respect
to the theory of religion.</p>

<p>If we begin with the true and pure idea of God, it
is the idea of a Being infinite in power and intelligence,
and though perfectly good, yet good by an unchangeable
internal determination of character, and
not by the constraint of an external law.</p>

<p>Such was the starting-point, from which the human
mind had to run its career of religious belief or speculation.
But the maintenance subjectively of the original
form of the image in its clearness depended, of
course, upon the condition of the observing organ; and
that organ, again, depended for its health on the healthiness
of the being to whom it belonged. Hence we
must look into the nature of man, in order to know
what man would think respecting the nature of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Downward course of the idea of God.</i></div>

<p>Now man, the prey of vicious passions, though he
holds deeply rooted within himself the witness to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
extrinsic and objective law of goodness, which he needs
in order to develop what he has of capacity for good,
and to bring into subjection the counteracting and rebellious
elements, is nevertheless prevailingly under
the influence of these last. Hence, in the absence of
special and Divine provision for the remedy of his inward
disease, although both conscience and also the
dispensations of Providence shadow forth to him a law
of goodness from without, yet the sense of any internal
law of goodness in himself becomes, with the lapse of
time, more and more dim and ineffectual.</p>

<p>Thus, as he reflects back upon his own image conceptions
of the Deity, the picture that he draws first
fails in that, wherein he himself is weakest. Now, the
perception of mere power depends upon intellect and
sense: and as neither intellect nor sense have received
through sin the same absolutely mortal wound which has
reached his spiritual being, he can therefore still comprehend
with clearness the idea and the uses of power,
both mental and physical. Accordingly, the Godhead is
for him preternaturally endowed with intelligence and
force. But how was he to keep alive from his own resources
the moral elements of the divine ideal? Coercive
goodness, goodness by an external law, goodness
dependent upon responsibility, was, by the nature of the
case, inapplicable to Deity as such: while of goodness
by an internal law, he had lost all clear conception,
and he could not give what he had not got.</p>

<p>Of course it is not meant, that this was a conscious
operation. Rarely indeed, in reflective and critical
periods, does it happen that man can keep a log-book
of wind, weather, and progress, for the mind, or tell
from what quarter of the heavens have proceeded the
gales that impel it on its course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>But, by this real though unconscious process, goodness
would soon disappear from his conception of the
Godhead, while high power and intelligence might remain.
And hence it is not strange, if we find that
Homer’s deities, possessed of power beyond their faculty
of moral direction, are for the most part, when viewed
in the sphere of their personal conduct, on a lower level
than his heroes.</p>

<p>When therefore these latter charge, as is not unfrequent
with them, upon the gods the consequences, and
even in a degree the facts, of their own fault or folly,
the proceeding is not so entirely illogical as we might
at first suppose. For that great conception of an all-good
and all-wise Being had undergone a miserable
transmutation, bringing it more and more towards the
form of an evil power. Hence, perhaps, it is that we
find these reproaches to the Deity put into the mouth
even of Menelaus, one of the noblest and purest characters
among the heroes of Homer<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>Again, this degradation of the divine idea was essentially
connected with the parcelling it out into many
portions, according to the system of polytheism. That
system at once brought down all the attributes from
their supreme perfection to scales of degree: established
finite and imperfect relations in lieu of the perfect and
infinite: carried into the atmosphere of heaven an
earthy element. The disintegration of the Unity of
God prepared the way for the disintegration of His
several attributes, and especially for weakening and
effacing those among them, which man had chiefly lost
his capacity to grasp.</p>

<p>When once we have substituted for the absolute
that which is in degree, and for the perfect that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
is defective, we have brought the divine element within
the cognizance of the human: the barrier of separation
is broken down, and, without any consciousness of
undue license, we thenceforward insensibly fashion it
as we please. Each corruption, as it takes its place in
the scheme of popular ideas, is consolidated by the
action of new forces, over and above those which, even
if alone, were sufficient to engender it: for the classes,
who worked the machinery both of priestly caste, and
of civil government, found their account in accumulating
fable up to a mountain mass. Each new addition
found a welcome: but woe to him, who, by shaking
the popular persuasion of any one article, endangered
the very foundations of the whole.</p>

<p>Such is an outline, though a faint and rude one, of
what may be called the <i>rationale</i>, or the law of cause
and effect, applicable to the explanation of the progressive
and, at length, total corruption of the primitive
religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Inducements to Nature-worship.</i></div>

<p>We may also endeavour to trace the motives which
might determine the downward movement of the human
mind in the direction, partially or wholly according
to circumstances, of what is called Nature-worship.</p>

<p>On the one side lay the proposition handed down
from the beginning&mdash;there is a God. On the other
side arose the question&mdash;where is He? It was felt that
on the whole He was not in man, though there was in
man what was of Him. It was obvious to look for Him
in the mighty agencies, and in the sublime objects of
Nature, which, though (so thought might run,) they did
not reveal Him entirely, yet disclosed nothing that was
not worthy to belong to Him. Here is a germ of Nature-worship.
Hence it is that we find Aristotle, at a
period when thought was alike acute, deliberate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
refined, declare it to be beyond all doubt that the heavenly
bodies are far more divine than man<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>Now this germ could not be one only. Trains of
thought and reasoning, essentially alike, would, according
to diversities of minds and circumstances, lead one
to place the God in one natural sphere or agency, and
another to place him in another. There was no commanding
principle either to confine or to reconcile
these variations; thus the same cause, which brought
deity into natural objects, would also tend to exhibit
many gods instead of one.</p>

<p>Such was the path by which man might travel from
Theism to Nature-worship. But other paths, starting
from other points, would lead to the same issue.</p>

<p>Suppose now the case of the mind wholly without
the tradition of a God. To such a mind, the vast and
overmastering but usually regulated forces, and the
beautiful and noble forms of nature, would of themselves
suggest the idea of a superior agency; yet,
again, not of one superior agent alone, but of many.
Thus some men would build upwards, while others, so
to speak, were building downwards, and they would
meet on the way.</p>

<p>And, again, a third operation could not but assist
these two former, and combine with their results. For
the unaided intellect of man seems not to have had
<i>stamina</i> to carry, as it were, the weight of the transcendent
idea of one God, of God infinite in might, in
wisdom, and in love. Again, it was awful as well as
ponderous; because it was so remote from man, and
from his actual state. He therefore lightened the idea,
as it were, by dividing it from one into many; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
brought it nearer to himself, nearer to his sympathies,
by humanizing its form and attributes. By this process
he in time destroyed indeed his reverence, but he also
beguiled his fears, and created for himself objects not
of dread, so much as of familiar association.</p>

<p>Yet once again; it may, I think, be shown that a
kind of natural necessity led man to denominate actual
powers, which he saw and felt about him, not through
the medium of generalization by abstract names, but
by making them persons.</p>

<p>Thus easy, and almost inevitable, under mental laws,
was the road to Nature-worship. The path, that led
into the deeper corruption of Passion-worship, has been
already traced.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Progressive deterioration.</i></div>

<p>It is then in entire accordance with what has preceded,
that, when the Pagan system has come into its
old age, we should find it so wholly deprived of all the
lineaments of original beauty, grandeur, and goodness,
that we can read the destructive philosophy and poetry
of the atheistic schools, and of Lucretius in particular,
without the strong sentiment of horror, which in themselves
they are fitted to excite.</p>

<p>Milton, in the First Book of Paradise Lost, treats
the Pagan gods as being, under new names, so many of
the fallen angels, who with Satan had rebelled, and
with him had been driven out from heaven, so that the
world of heathen from the first had simply</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">‘devils to adore for deities.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Whether this sentiment be poetically warrantable
or not, (and for my own part I cannot but think it was
one too much connected with a cold and lowered form
of Christian doctrine,) it is not historically sound. We
should distinguish broadly between this assertion, that
the Pagan religion was an original falsehood, and the
declaration of St. Paul, ‘I say that the things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to
God<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.’ To the same class as the words of the Apostle,
belong, as I conceive, these (and other) sentences of
Saint Augustine<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non sunt dii, maligni sunt spiritus,
quibus æterna tua felicitas pœna est.... Proinde si ad
beatam pervenire desideras civitatem, devita dæmonum
societatem</i>. For these terrible descriptions apply not to
the infancy, but to the decrepitude of Paganism. The
difference between them was as the difference between
the babe in arms, and the hoary sinner on the threshold
of death: and while the one representation summarily
cuts man off from God, the other only shows to how fearful
a distance he had by degrees travelled away. As time
went on, and the <i>eidola</i> of succeeding generations were
heaped one upon another, the truly theistic element in
the Pagan mythology was more and more hidden and
overborne, until at length its association with evil was
so inveterate and thorough, that the images, which the
citizen or matron of the Roman empire had before the
mind as those of gods, bore no appreciable resemblance
to their divine original, but more and more amply corresponded
with that dark side of our nature, on which
we are accessible to, and finally may assume the likeness
of, the evil one.</p>

<p>But the critical error that we seem to have committed
may be thus described; we have thrown back upon the
Homeric period the moral and mythological character
of the system, such as we find it developed in later
Greece and Rome: forgetful of the long and dim interval,
that separates Homeric religion from almost every
subsequent representation, and not duly appreciating
the title of the poems to speak with an almost exclusive
authority for their own insulated epoch.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Paganism in its decay.</i></div>

<p>Further, it is reasonable to remember that some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the powerful alteratives, which in subsequent ages told
upon the form and substance of this wonderful mythology,
had not begun to act in the time of Homer.
These alteratives were speculative thought, and political
interests. Philosophy, ever dangerous to the
popular religion of Greece in the days of its maturity
and prosperity, became its ally in the period of its decline,
when its original vitality had entirely ebbed
away, and when the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vexilla Regis</i>, raised aloft throughout
the Roman empire, drove it to seek refuge in
holes and corners. Then the wit of man was set to
repair the tottering fabric; to apologize for what was
profligate, to invent reasons for what was void of meaning,
to frame relations between the depraved mythology,
and the moral government of the world. Even
that corrupt and wicked system had, as it were, its
epoch of death-bed repentance.</p>

<p>The services thus rendered by philosophers were late
and ineffectual; but it was the civil power, which had
been all along the greatest conservator of the classical
mythology. It felt itself to have an interest in surrounding
public authority with a veneration greater
than this world could supply: a commanding interest,
with the pursuit of which its necessities forbade it to
dispense. Whatever exercised an influence in subduing
and enthralling the popular mind, answered its purpose
in the view of the civil magistrate. Hence his multifarious
importations into religion, each successively introduced
for this purely subjective and temporal reason,
removed it farther and farther from the ground of truth.
Every story that he added to the edifice made its fall
more certain and more terrible. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Numerosa parabat excelsæ
turris tabulata.</i> But in Homer’s time there is no
trace of this employment of religion by governments,
as a means of sheer imposition upon their subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>So likewise in Homer there is no sign that conscious
speculation on these subjects had begun. Indeed,
of that kind of thought which involves a clear
mental self-consciousness, we may perhaps say, that
the first beginning, at least for Europe and the West,
is marked by the very curious simile in the <span class="lock">Iliad<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὡς δ’ ὅτ’ ἂν ἀΐξῃ νόος ἀνέρος κ.τ.λ.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Homer, then, spoke out in simplicity, and in good faith,
the religion of his day, under those forms of poetry
with which all religions have a well-grounded affinity:
for the imagination, which is the fountain-head of
poetic forms, is likewise a genuine, though faint, picture,
of that world which religion realizes, through
Faith its groundwork, ‘the substance of things hoped
for, the evidence of things not seen<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.’</p>

<p>And, indeed, he had no other form in which to
speak forth his soul. That which we call the invention
of the Greeks at work upon the subject-matter of
religion was, in fact, the voice of human nature, giving
expression in the easiest and simplest manner to its
sense of the great objects and powers amidst which its
lot was cast. It has been well said by Professor M.
Müller, in an able Essay<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> on ‘Comparative Mythology,’
that ‘abstract speech is more difficult, than the
fulness of a poet’s sympathy with nature.’ Thus it was
not so much that poetry usurped the office of religion,
as that their respective functions brought them of
necessity to a common ground and a common form of
proceeding. Homer saw, heard, or felt the action of
the sun, the moon, the stars, the atmosphere, the
winds, the sea, the rivers, the fountains, the soil; and
he knew of family affections, of governing powers, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
healing art, of a gift and skill of mechanical construction.
Action, in each of these departments, could not
but be referred to a power. How was that power to
be expressed?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>On Impersonation in Homer.</i></div>

<p>At least for the Greek mind, less subtle, as Aristotle
has observed, than the Oriental, it was more natural to
deal with persons, than with metaphysical abstractions.
It was foreign to the mental habit of the heroic age to
conceive of abstract essences; as it still remains difficult,
more difficult perhaps than, in the looseness of our
mental processes, we suppose, for the men of our own
generation. Even now, in the old age of the world, we
have many signs of this natural difficulty, which formerly
was a kind of impossibility. Especially we have that
one which leads all communities, and above all their
least instructed classes, to apply the personal pronouns
<i>he</i> or <i>she</i> to a vast multitude of inanimate objects, both
natural, and the products of human skill and labour.
These objects are generally such as stand in a certain
relation to action: they either do, suffer, or contain.</p>

<p>If then the Nature-forces could not be expressed, or
at least could not be understood as abstractions, to express
them as persons was the only other course open to
the poet. It was not an effort to follow this method: it
would have required great effort to adopt any other.
How spontaneous was the impulse which thus generated
the mythological system, we may observe from
this, that it not only personified in cases where, an
agency being seen, its fountain was concealed from
view, but it likewise went very far towards personification
even in cases where inanimate instruments were
wielded by human beings, and where, as the source of
the phenomenon was perceived, there was no occasion
to clothe it with a separate vitality. Hence that copious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
vivifying power which Homer has poured like a flood
through his verse. Hence his bitter arrow (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πικρὸς</span>), his
darts hungry for human blood (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λιλαιόμενα χρόος ἆσαι</span>),
his ground laughing in the blaze of the gleaming armour
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γέλασσε δὲ πᾶσα περὶ χθὼν χαλκοῦ ὑπὸ στεροπῆς</span>).
Hence again his free use of sensible imagery to illustrate
metaphysical ideas: for example, his black cloud
of grief, his black pains, his purple death<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. Hence that
singularly beautiful passage on the weeping of the deathless
horses of Achilles for Patroclus<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. Hence too it is,
that he does not scruple to carry imagery, drawn from
the sphere of one sense, into the domain of another, an
operation which later poets have found so difficult and
hazardous. He has an iron din<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, a brazen voice<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, a
brazen or iron heaven<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, a howling or shouting fire, a
blaze of lamentation<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. Hence, by a system of figure
bolder perhaps than has been used by any other poet,
he invests the works of high art in metal with the attributes
of life and motion. This daring system reaches
its climax in the damsel satellites<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of gold, that support
the limping gait of Vulcan: in the dogs of metal, that
guard the palace of Alcinous: in the elastic arms of
Achilles, which, so far from being a weight upon him,
themselves lift him from the ground: and in the animated
ships of the Phæacians, which are taught by
instinct to speed across the sea, and to pilot their own
course to the points of their destination<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. On every side
we see a redundance of life, shaping, and even forcing,
for itself new channels: and thus it becomes more easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for us to conceive the important truth that, when he
impersonates, he simply takes what was for him the
easiest and the most effective way to describe. Every
where he is carrying on a double process of action and
reaction: on the one hand bringing Deity down to
sensible forms; on the other, adorning and elevating
humanity, and inanimate nature, with every divine endowment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nature of the myths of Homer.</i></div>

<p>Homer, then, is full of mythical matter. But the
word <i>myth</i>, of which in recent controversies the use has
been so frequent, is capable of being viewed under
either of two principal aspects.</p>

<p>In one of these, it signifies a story which is not contemporary
with the date of the facts it purports to relate,
but is in reality an after-view of them, which
colours its subject, and exaggerates, <i>ad libitum</i>, according
to conditions of thought and feeling which
have arisen in the interval.</p>

<p>In the other of these senses, it is an allegory which
has simply lost its counterpart: it was true, but by
separation from that which attached it to fact, it has
become untrue: being now of necessity handled, if
handled at all, as a substantive existence, it has passed
into a fable, and is only distinguished from pure fable,
in that it once indicated truths contemporary with
itself, though probably truths lying in a different region
from its own.</p>

<p>It is in this last sense that the term myth is chiefly,
and most legitimately, applicable to the religious system
of the Homeric poems: but they may also probably
contain more or less of the mythical element in the
former sense.</p>

<p>We, having obtained knowledge of the early derivation
and distribution of mankind, and of the primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
religion, from sources other than those open to Homer,
shall find in this knowledge the lost counterpart of a
great portion of the Homeric myths.</p>

<p>The theological and Messianic traditions which we
find recorded in Scripture, when compared with the
Homeric theogony, will be found to correspond with a
large and important part of it: and, moreover, with a
part of it which in the poems themselves carries a
cluster of distinctive marks, not to be explained except
by the discovery of this correspondence. The evidence,
therefore, of the meaning of this part of the Homeric
system is like that which is obtained, when, upon
applying a new key to some lock that we have been
unable to open, we find it fits the wards, and puts back
the bolt.</p>

<p>In his learned and acute Essay<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> on Comparative Mythology,
Professor Max Müller undertakes to illustrate
a doctrine that appears to be the exact opposite of
Mr. Grote’s ‘Past which was never present.’ If I understand
him rightly, there was at some one time a present
for every portion of the reputed past<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>: so that, by
a reference to eastern sources, the nature of that present,
and of the original consistent meaning for what afterwards
on becoming unintelligible is justly called a
myth, has in many cases been, and may yet in many
more come to be, unveiled. Originally impersonations
of ideas and natural powers, the heathen gods never
represented demons or evil spirits<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, and were ‘masks
without an actor,’ ‘names without being:’ while their
reality, consisting in their relation to the facts of the
universe, faded and escaped from perception in the
course of time. The myths of the Veda are still in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the stage of growth: Hesiod and Homer too are of
the ‘later Greeks,’ and not only the Theogony of
Hesiod is ‘a distorted caricature,’ but the poetry
of Homer<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is extensively founded on myths fully
grown, and in the stage of decay, that is to say, long
severed from their corresponding deities.</p>

<p>I do not doubt that in all mythology at its origin,
there has been both a shell and a substance: and that
the tendency of the two to part company, which we see
even under the sway of revealed religion, must have
operated with far more power, where ordinarily at least,
man was thrown back, without other aid, upon his reason
and his conscience, beset as they were and are with
overpowering foes.</p>

<p>But then, as it seems to me, we must anticipate
great changes in the shell itself. It will not retain,
when empty, the identity of the form; which has lost
the support that it had from within when full. On the
contrary, it will become unlike its original self, as well
as unlike its archetype or substance, so that probably
much of it must always remain without a key.</p>

<p>Upon the other hand, as there was already a true religion
in the world when an untrue one began to gather
upon and incrust it, there must arise the question already
put; what, according to the theory before us, became of
this true religion? It did not disappear in a day: there
was no wilful renunciation of it by single or specific
acts, no sharp line drawn between it and the false; but
the human element was gradually more and more imported
into the divine, operating by continual and successive
disintegrations of the original ideas. If so, then
there seems to be nothing unreasonable in the belief
that the traces of them might long remain discernible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in the adulterated system, even if only as the features
of a man are discernible in the mask of a buffoon.</p>

<p>No doubt it would be unreasonable to look for such
traces in Homer, if he were indeed, in the popular
sense of the term, which probably Professor M. Müller
does not intend, a later Greek; a Greek dealing with a
mythological system of which his nation had already
had its use, from which the creative principle had departed,
and which was on the road from ripeness to
decay. I am far from saying that there are no myths
in Homer, where the original and interior meaning has
ceased to be discernible: but I shall seek to show that
the contrary may be confidently averred, and fully
shown, with respect to the great bulk of his mythology,
and that we see in him two systems, both alive,
and in impact and friction, though with very unequal
forces, one upon the other; the first, that of traditional
truth, and the second, of the inventive impersonation
of nature both material and invisible. And certainly
it is very striking that, with one or two very insignificant
exceptions, all those ancient fables, which Professor
Müller treats as having become unintelligible without
the key of the Veda, and which he explains by means
of it, are fables unknown to Homer, and drawn from
much later sources.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Steps of the downward process.</i></div>

<p>The general view, then, which will be given in these
pages of the Homeric Theo-mythology is as follows:
That its basis is not to be found either in any mere
human instinct gradually building it up from the
ground, or in the already formed system of any other
nation of antiquity; but that its true point of origin lies
in the ancient Theistic and Messianic traditions, which
we know to have subsisted among the patriarchs, and
which their kin and contemporaries must have carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
with them as they dispersed, although their original
warmth and vitality could not but fall into a course of
gradual efflux, with the gradually widening distance
from their source. To travel beyond the reach of the
rays proceeding from that source was to make the first
decisive step from religion to mythology.</p>

<p>To this divine tradition, then, were added, in rank
abundance, elements of merely human fabrication,
which, while intruding themselves, could not but also
extrude the higher and prior parts of religion. But the
divine tradition, as it was divine, would not admit of
the accumulation of human materials until it had itself
been altered. Even before men could add, it was necessary
that they should take away. This impairing and
abstraction of elements from the divine tradition may
be called disintegration.</p>

<p>Before the time of Homer, it had already wrought
great havock. Its first steps, as far as the genesis of the
mythology throws light upon them, would appear to have
been as follows: objectively, a fundamental corruption
of the idea of God; who, instead of an Omnipotent
wisdom and holiness, now in the main represented on a
large scale, in personal character, the union of appetite
and power; subjectively, the primary idea of religion
was wholly lost. Adam, says Lord Bacon, was not
content with universal obedience to the Divine Will as
his rule of action, but would have another standard.
This offence, though not exaggerated into the hideousness
of human depravity in its later forms, is represented
without mitigation in the principles of action current
in the heroic age. Human life, as it is there exhibited,
has much in it that is noble and admirable; but
nowhere is it a life of simple obedience to God.</p>

<p>This disintegration of primitive traditions forms the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
second stage, a negative one, in the process which produced
the Homeric Theo-mythology.</p>

<p>When the divine idea, and also the idea of the relation
between man and his Maker, had once been fundamentally
changed, there was now room for the introduction
without limit of what was merely human into
religion. Instead of man’s being formed in the image
of God, God was formed in the image of man. The
ancient traditions were made each to assume a separate
individual form; and these shapes were fashioned by
magnifying and modifying processes from the pattern
that human nature afforded.</p>

<p>Again, as man does not exist alone and individually,
but in the family, so the <i>nexus</i> of the family was introduced
as the basis of a divine order. This we may call,
resting on the etymology of the word, the divine Œconomy
of the Homeric religion.</p>

<p>But as with man, so with the supernatural world, on
which his own genius was now powerfully reflected,
families themselves, when multiplied, required a political
order; and therefore, among the gods also a State
and government are formed, a divine polity. Human
care, by a strange inversion, makes parental provision
for the good government of those deities whom it has
called into being.</p>

<p>The propagation, for which a physical provision was
made among men, takes place within the mythological
circle also, under the laws of his intelligent nature. The
ranks of the Immortals are filled with persons metaphysically
engendered. These persons they represent concrete
forms given to abstract ideas, or, to state nearly the
same thing in other words, personal modes of existence
assigned to powers which man saw as it were alive and
at work in the universe, physical or intelligent, around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
him. But here too a distinction is to be observed.
Sometimes the deity was set above the natural power,
as its governor and controller: sometimes he merely
signified the power itself put in action. The former
mode commonly points to tradition; the latter always
to invention.</p>

<p>And lastly, when a supernatural <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοσμὸς</span> or order had
thus been constructed, the principles of affinity between
it and the order here below exercised a reciprocally
attractive force. The gods were more and more
humanized, man was more and more invested with
deity: deity was made cheap and common among men,
and the interval from earth to heaven was bridged
over by various means. These means were principally;
first, the translation of men into the company of the
immortals; secondly, the introduction of intermediate
races; and, thirdly and most of all, the deification of
heroes.</p>

<p>Subordinate to this general view, there arises another
question: how are we to subdivide the inventive
parts of the Homeric mythology? What general statements
can be propounded, or criteria supplied, to show
how much Greece fabricated or moulded for herself, and
what she owed to Egypt, or to Phœnicia, or to other
lands in the East, whose traditions she had either inherited
or received?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sources of the inventive portions.</i></div>

<p>A deep obscurity hangs over this subject. We do
not know all that was contained in each of the various
religions of the East at any one epoch, much less at
all the periods within which they may have contributed
materials to the gorgeous fabric of Homer. Many
things were probably common to several of them: and
where this was so, circumstantial evidence cannot avail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
for determining the source at which the Poet or his
nation borrowed.</p>

<p>But several propositions may be laid down, which
will tend towards describing the path of our inquiry.</p>

<p>First, the accounts which, transmitted by Herodotus,
represent Egypt as the fountain-head of the
Greek religion in its mass, are not sustained by the
evidence of Homer. And even with respect to many
points where the nucleus of the Greek system has
something corresponding with it in the Egyptian, it
neither follows that it was originally drawn from
Egypt by the Greeks, nor that those from whom the
Greeks received it had obtained it there. Yet there
remains room for very important communications,
such, for example, as the oracle of Dodona, or the
worship of Minerva, which may be an historic token of
an Egyptian colony at Athens.</p>

<p>Secondly, the correspondences between the Homeric
system and the Eastern religions, as we know them,
are commonly latent, rather than broad or palpable.
This may, in part, be owing to the circumstance that
our accounts of these religions are in great part so much
later than Homer; and a greater resemblance, than is
now to be traced, may have subsisted in his time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Originality of the Olympian system.</i></div>

<p>But, thirdly, the differences are not differences of
detail or degree. A different spirit pervades the Homeric
creed and worship, from that which we find in
Egyptian, or Median, or Persian systems. One has grovelling
animalism, another has metaphysical aspirations,
that we do not find in the Greek: but this is not all.
If the Homeric scheme is capable of being described,
as to its inventive part, by any one epithet, it will be
this, that it is intensely human. I do not speak of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
later mythology; nor of Hesiod, whose Theogony so
marvellously spoils what it systematizes; but of Homer,
in whom the ideal Olympus attained its perfection at a
stroke. In his preternatural <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοσμὸς</span> there is, as far as I
can see, much more of what is truly Divine, much more
of the residue of primeval tradition, than we can find
collected elsewhere: but there is also much more of
what is human. The moral form is corrupt: but I am
now also speaking of it as a work of human genius, and
certainly as one of the most wonderful and splendid of
its products. The deep sympathy with Nature, the refined
perception of beauty, the freedom, the buoyancy,
the elastic movement of every figure on the scene, the
intimate sense of association between the denizens of
Olympus and the generations of mortal men, the imposing
development of a Polity on high, the vivid
nationality that riveted its hold on Greece, the richness
and inexhaustible diversity of those embellishments
which a vigorous fancy knows how to provide, combine
to make good the title I have asserted, and, if we are
to believe that Homer, in no small part, made what he
described, must place his share in the formation of the
system in the very foremost rank even of his achievements.</p>

<p>At any rate, this one thing, I think, is clear; that
whatever Greece borrowed from the East, she fairly
made her own. All was thrown into the crucible; all
came out again from the fire recast, in such combinations,
and clothed in such forms and hues, as the specific
exigencies of the Greek mind required. Hence
we must beware of all precipitate identifications. We
must take good heed, for example, not to assume, that
because Athene may be Neith by metathesis, therefore
the features of the Homeric Pallas were really gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
together in the Egyptian prototype of her name<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. The
strong hand of a transmuting fancy and intelligence
passed as a preliminary condition upon everything
foreign, not only to modify, but probably also to resolve
into parts, and then to reconstruct. So that the
preternatural system of Homer is, above all others,
both national and original, and has, by its own vital
energies, helped to maintain those characteristics even
in the deteriorated copies which were made from it by
so many after-generations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">SECT. II.<br />

<i>The traditive Element of the Homeric
Theo-mythology.</i></h2></div>

<p>The earliest Scriptural narrative presents to our
view, with considerable distinctness, three main objects.
These are, respectively, God, the Redeemer, and
the Evil One. Nor do we pass even through the Book
of Genesis without finding, that it shadows forth some
mysterious combination of Unity with Trinity in the
Divine Nature.</p>

<p>From the general expectation which prevailed in
the East at the period of the Advent, and from the
prophecies collected and carefully preserved in Rome
under the name of the Sibylline books, we are at once
led to presume, that the knowledge of the early promise
of a Deliverer had not been confined to the Jewish
nation. Their exclusive character, and that of their
religion; their small significance in the political system
and intellectual movement of the world; and the false
as well as imperfect notions which seem to have prevailed
elsewhere respecting them and their law<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>; all
make it highly improbable that these expectations and
predictions should have been drawn from them and
their sacred books exclusively. Further, Holy Scripture
distinctly exhibits to us the existence of channels
of traditional knowledge severed from theirs. Thus
much we learn particularly from the cases of Job, who
was a prophet and servant of God, though he lived in a
country where idolatry was practised<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>; and of Balaam,
who, not being an Israelite, nor an upright man, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
nevertheless a prophet also. Our Lord, in his answer
respecting God as the God of Abraham<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, points to a
great article of belief, not expressly propounded in the
Mosaic books. And again, there are traditions adopted
in the New Testament by apostolic authority, which
prove to us that there were some fragments at least of
early tradition remaining, even at a late date, among
the Jews themselves, over and above what had been
committed to writing in the older Scriptures. Such
are those given by St. Jude respecting Balaam himself,
the body of Moses, and the prophecy of Enoch<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. Such
is the record mentioned by St. Paul<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of Jannes and
Jambres, who are believed to have been the chief magicians
of Pharaoh, referred to in Exodus, c. vii: and
whose names are mentioned by Pliny, and, according
to Eusebius, by Numenius the Philosopher<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. But it is
not necessary, and it might not be safe, to make any
large assumption respecting a traditional knowledge of
any parts of early revelation beyond what Scripture
actually contains.</p>

<p>Dwelling therefore on what may be gathered from
the Sacred Volume, we have seen that at the very
earliest date it has set before men the ideas of God, the
Redeemer, and the Evil One, and that it has spoken
concerning God as in some sense Three in One. When
we take the whole of the older Sacred Records into
view, we may add some particulars respecting the
other two great objects.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Messianic traditions of Scripture.</i></div>

<p>And first, as to the Deliverer of man. The Redeemer
promised was to be human, for He was to be of human
birth. As death was the type of the primeval curse, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
it was from death that He was to deliver. Again, the
woman became a portion of the prophecy, for He was
to be the seed of the woman: and while He is thus
plainly indicated to us as incarnate, He is, on the
other hand, mysteriously identified with the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λόγος</span>, the
Divine Word or Wisdom, existing before the world
and the race with which He was to be numbered, and
invested with the attributes of supreme Deity. Although
from a certain period the Wisdom and the
Deliverer appear to stand visibly identified, yet the
earliest forms of the traditions, as they stand in Holy
Writ, are, to a certain extent, ideally separate or separable;
and the personality of the former is less clearly,
or at least less sharply, marked than that of the latter.</p>

<p>It was always the prevailing tendency of the speculative
religions of the East to withdraw the Supreme
Being from direct relations with the world, and to
assign its ordinary government to the Wisdom, more or
less directly impersonated. ‘This,’ says Dean Milman,
‘was the doctrine from the Ganges, or even the shores
of the Yellow Sea, to the Ilissus: it was the fundamental
principle of the Indian religion and Indian philosophy;
it was the basis of Zoroastrianism: it was
pure Platonism: it was the Platonic Judaism of the
Alexandrian School<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.’</p>

<p>Neither were the traditions of the Evil One, more
than those respecting the Messiah, limited to a single
aspect. On the contrary, they were twofold, and they
centred round two ideas: the one, that of force; the
other that of fraud: the one, that of a rebellious spirit,
whom the Almighty had cast down, with his abettors,
from bliss to torment<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>; and the other, that of a deceiver,
who lured man by the promise of what he desired, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
through the medium of his own free will, away from
duty, to his own harm or destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sum of the primitive traditions.</i></div>

<p>We may venture rudely to sum up these principal
traditions of the first ages as follows:</p>

<p>First, with respect to the Deity.</p>

<p>1. The Unity and supremacy of the Godhead.</p>

<p>2. A combination with this Unity of a Trinity, in
which Trinity the several Persons, in whatever way their
personality be understood, and whatever distinctions
may obtain between them, are in some way of coequal
honour.</p>

<p>Secondly, with respect to the Redeemer, or Messiah.</p>

<p>1. A Redeemer from the curse of death, invested with
full humanity, by whom the divine kingdom was to be
vindicated and reestablished, in despite of its enemies.</p>

<p>2. A Wisdom, which is personal as well as divine,
the highest and first in order, concerned in the foundation
and continuing government of the world<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. This is
the Wisdom which ‘the Lord possessed from everlasting,
from the beginning, or ever the earth was<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.’
‘I Wisdom dwell with prudence; and find out knowledge
of witty inventions<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.’ ‘This is with all flesh according
to his gift: and he hath given her to them that
love him<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.’</p>

<p>3. The connection of the Redeemer with our race
through his descent from the woman.</p>

<p>Thirdly, with respect to the Evil One.</p>

<p>1. A rebellion of great angels or powers against the
Supreme Being; the defeat of the rebels, and their
being cast into the abyss.</p>

<p>2. The going forth among men of a power who
tempts them to their destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>A tradition of minor moment, but clearly declared in
the earliest Scripture, may be added: namely,</p>

<p>The announcement of the rainbow, as a token which
was to convey an assurance or covenant from God to
man, with respect to the annual order of nature; an
order on which the continuance of the human race depends.</p>

<p>It is impossible to survey these traditions, in their
outline, without seeing how easy it was to find a way
from them, by the aid of ideas on which they seemed to
border, and which they brought within easy reach of
wayward thought, towards the principal corruptions of
heathenism. They shadow forth, as they stand, the great
dogmas of the Trinity and the Incarnation: but from
the doctrine of the Trinity, thus shadowed forth, the next
step might be into polytheism; while in the doctrine of
the Incarnation, similarly projected, seemed to be laid
the foundation of the Greek anthropomorphism, or the
reflection of humanity upon the supernatural world.
Abstract truth has not been found sufficient to sustain
itself among mankind: and in the dispensations of the
All-Wise the promulgation of it has always been associated
with the establishment of a teaching organ,
which should bear living witness to its authority.</p>

<p>Let us now observe how these traditions severally
find their imperfect and deranged counterparts in the
heroic age of Greece.</p>

<p>First, as to the Godhead.</p>

<p>Its unity and supremacy is represented in Jupiter, as
the administrator of sovereign power.</p>

<p>The combination of Trinity with Unity is reproduced
in the three Kronid brothers, Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto
or Aidoneus; all born of the same parents, and having
different regions of the material creation severally assigned
to them by lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Next as to the Redeemer.</p>

<p>The first form of this tradition is represented chiefly
in Apollo. But neither the various attributes which
were conceived as belonging to the Deliverer, nor the
twofold manifestation of his character as it appears in
Holy Writ, could, we must conclude, be held in combination
by the heathen mind. The character, therefore,
underwent a marked disintegration by severance into
distinct parts: and while it continues, in the main, to
form the groundwork of the Homeric Apollo, certain
of its qualities are apparently transferred to his sister
Diana, and others of them are, as it were, repeated in
her.</p>

<p>The second form of the tradition is that of the Wisdom,
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λόγος</span>, of the Gospel of Saint John; and this
appears to be represented in the sublime Minerva of
the Homeric system.</p>

<p>Lastly, Latona, the mother of the twin deities,
Apollo and Diana, appears to represent the tradition of
the woman, from whom the Deliverer was to descend.</p>

<p>Thirdly, with respect to the Evil One.</p>

<p>As the derivative idea of sin depended upon that of
goodness, and as the shadow ceases to be visible when
the object shadowed has become more dim, we might
well expect that the contraction and obscuration of the
true idea of goodness would bring about a more than
proportionate loss of knowledge concerning the true
nature of evil. The impersonation of evil could only be
upheld in a lively or effectual manner, as the opposite
of the impersonation of good: and when the moral
standard of godhead had so greatly degenerated, as we
find to be the case even in the works of Homer, the
negation of that standard could not but cease to be
either interesting or intelligible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Traditions of the Evil One in Homer.</i></div>

<p>Accordingly we find that the process of disintegra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>tion,
followed by that of arbitrary reassortment and
combination of elements, had proceeded to a more advanced
stage with respect to the tradition of the Evil
One, than in the other cases.</p>

<p>The general form of the disintegration is this: that
the idea of a rebellion, menacing the divine dominion
with violence, is now clothed in a variety of detached
and more or less conflicting forms: while the far more
subtle idea of an influence acting immediately on the
spirit of man, and aiming a blow at the glory of the
Deity through his creatures, whose allegiance it seeks
by the perversion of their own spontaneous agency to
withdraw, remains in Homer, still indeed both visible
and single, but enfeebled and obscured to such a degree,
that it, as it were, stands on tiptoe, ready for its final
flight from the sphere of the common perceptions of
mankind.</p>

<p>The first, the idea of evil acting by violence, is represented,
not indeed exclusively, but most conspicuously,
in the Titans and Giants.</p>

<p>The second, or the idea of evil acting by deceit, is
represented in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> of Homer.</p>

<p>Lastly: the rainbow of Holy Scripture is represented
in the Homeric Iris.</p>

<p>These, then, speaking generally, are the principal
remnants from primitive traditions, of which, if of any
thing of the kind, we may expect to find the vestiges
within the Olympian Court.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Varying degrees of the traditive character.</i></div>

<p>In order to throw a fuller light upon the subject, I
shall chiefly examine the characters of the Homeric
deities, and of the more important among them in particular,
not as a body but individually. An opposite
practice has for the most part prevailed. It has been
assumed that they are homogeneous; they have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
treated as a class, subject to the same laws; and variations,
not to be accounted for from mythological <i>data</i>,
have been viewed as mere solecisms in the conception
of the class. This has mainly tended, I believe, to thrust
the truth of the case into dark corners. But the properties
which distinguish the Homeric Immortals in common
from men are in reality less important than those
which establish rules of discrimination within their
own body, and which point to the very different sources
that have supplied the materials incorporated into different
portions of the scheme.</p>

<p>In the enumeration which it will be requisite to
make, it might be allowable to treat Neptune and
Pluto as traditive divinities, because in their relation
to Jupiter, which abstractedly is one of equal birth and
equal honour, they appear to share in representing the
primitive tradition, which combined a trine personality
with unity in the godhead. Effect was given to this tradition
by supposing the existence of three deities, who
were united by the bond of brotherhood, and of whom
each had an important portion of the universe assigned
to his immediate superintendence. But for the assignment
of attributes to these personages, when severally
constituted, tradition seems to have afforded no aid.
Jupiter, as the eldest and most powerful, became heir
general, as it were, to whatever ideas were current
respecting the one supreme God: or the point might
be otherwise stated, as for instance thus, that the conception
which the Greeks derived from elsewhere of a
supreme God, they, on taking it over, shaped into the
Eldest Brother of their Trinity. But the concentration
of ideas of supremacy upon him was at variance with,
and enfeebled the notion of, the trine combination.
The tradition itself, moreover, did not determine pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>vinces
for Neptune or Pluto; and consequently, though
these deities may be considered traditional with regard
to their basis, they belonged to the invented class as
respects character and attributes, and it is in conjunction
with that class that I propose to consider them.</p>

<p>Again, Jupiter does not fully represent any one specific
tradition: but he assembles irregularly around him
the fragments of such traditions as belonged to the relation
between men and the One Ruler of the universe.
On the one hand he is in competition with other
impersonations; on the other hand, with abstractions,
which, if they wanted the life, yet had not forfeited
the purity of godhead.</p>

<p>Latona, again, will be known rather by relative and
negative, than by absolute and positive, signs; except
as to the point of her maternity.</p>

<p>So Diana does not equally divide with Apollo, her
twin brother, the substance of the tradition that they
jointly represent; but rather is the figure of a person
on whom the residue, consisting of properties that the
Homeric Apollo could not receive, is bestowed. It is
mainly in her ancillary relation to Apollo that she
should be viewed.</p>

<p>It will of course be my object to bring out, as clearly
and fully as I can, that portion of the evidence, which
proves the presence of a strong traditive element in
the Theomythology of Homer.</p>

<p>But it is not free from difficulty to determine the best
mode of proceeding with this view. The traditive part
of the materials is not separated by a broad and direct
line from the inventive; nor has it been lodged without
admixture in any of the members of the Olympian
system. Like the fables of the East, it has undergone
the transforming action of the Greek mind, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
throughout the scheme variously mingled and combined
with ideas of human manufacture. There is scarcely
any element of the old revelation that is presented to our
view under unaltered conditions: scarcely any personage
of the divine order, as represented by the Poet,
stands in the same relation of resemblance to those
primeval traditions, which are to be traced in his figure
and attributes. The ancient truths are not merely imperfect;
they are dislocated, and, with heavy waste of
material in the process, afterwards recast.</p>

<p>On account of this bewildering diversity, it will, I
conceive, be most conducive to my purpose if I commence
the inquiry with those deities in whom the propositions
I maintain are best represented: for the
present putting aside others, in whom the representation
of tradition, either from the overpowering presence
of other elements, or from the general insignificance
of the character, is less effective.</p>

<p>I have spoken, thus far, of the ancient traditions, as
they are delivered either in the ancient or in the more
recent books of the Bible. And I hope it will not be
thought to savour of mere paradox, if the result of my
search into the text of Homer shall be to exhibit the
religion of the Greeks, in the heroic age, as possessed
of more resemblances to a primitive revelation, than
those religions of the East from which they must have
borrowed largely, and which we presume to have stood
between them and the fountain-head.</p>

<p>We have doubtless to consider the Greeks, as to
their religion, in three capacities: first, as receivers
of the remains of pristine tradition; secondly, as
having imported, along with it, from abroad the depraved
forms of human fable; thirdly, as themselves
powerful inventors, working upon and adding to both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
descriptions of material. But, before we conclude that
the religion of Homer must needs be farther from that
of the patriarchs than the religions, as we now read
them, of Persia, Assyria, or Egypt, we ought to be
assured that the editions, so to speak, in which we
study those religions, are older than the Homeric
poems. Whereas, with respect to the great bulk of the
records at our command, this, I apprehend, is the very
reverse of the truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Messianic traditions of the Hebrews.</i></div>

<p>There is, however, one source to which we may legitimately
repair, as next in authority to the Holy Scriptures
themselves with respect to the forms of primitive
tradition: I mean the earliest and most authentic
sacred literature of the Hebrews. Not that in kind it
can resemble the sacred records; but that it is at least
likely to indicate what were the earliest forms of development,
and the initial tendencies to deviation.</p>

<p>Since that nation became unhappily committed,
through its chief traditional authorities, to the repudiation
of the Redeemer, a sinister bias has operated upon
its retrospective, as well as upon its present and prospective
theology. There are nevertheless three depositaries
of knowledge from which we may hope to learn
what were the views, entertained by the ancient Hebrews
themselves, with regard to the all-absorbing subject
of the Messianic traditions.</p>

<p>In the first place it would appear, from the very
nature of the prophecies of the Old Testament, that
there must, in all likelihood, have existed along with
them a system of authoritative contemporary exposition,
in order that holy men might be enabled to
derive from them the consolation and instruction which,
apart from their other purposes, they were divinely
intended to convey. The highly figurative character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and frequent obscurity of their language supports, if it
does not require, this belief: and the constant practice,
attested by the later Scriptures, of public explanation
of the sacred Books, including the Prophets, in the
synagogues of the Jews, brings it as near as such a
case admits to demonstration.</p>

<p>These expositions of the Sacred Text began, as it
appears, to be committed to writing about the time
of the Babylonish captivity; when the Chaldee tongue
became the vernacular, and the old Hebrew disappeared
from common use. They were collected in the Paraphrases
or <i>Targumim</i>: and the fragments of the oldest
of them, which had consisted of marginal notes, were
consolidated into a continuous Targum by Onkelos, Jonathan,
and others<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from the Targumim, the sacred literature of
the Jews appears, from the time of the captivity onwards,
to have run in two main channels. One class of
teachers and writers rested chiefly on the dry traditionary
system condemned by our Saviour in the Gospels, and
gave less and less heed, as time went on, to the doctrine
of Scripture, and of their forefathers, concerning the
Messiah. In the second century after Christ, this traditionary
system was reduced by the Rabbi Jehuda into a
volume called the Mischna. And in the sixth or seventh,
there was composed a larger work, the Gemara or Talmud,
which purported in part to comment on the Mischna,
and which also presented a more extensive and
more promiscuous collection of Rabbinical traditions.
In the midst of the ordure of this work, says Schöttgen,
are to be found here and there certain pearls<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Parallel with this stream of chiefly spurious learning,
there was a succession of pious writers, who both
searched the Scriptures, and studied to maintain and
propagate the Messianic interpretations of them. Of
this succession the Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochai was the
great ornament; and by his disciples was compiled, some
sixty years after his death, or about A. D. 170, the work
termed the Sohar, which is so Christian in its sense, as
to have convinced Schöttgen that Simeon was himself
a Christian; although, perhaps from not being understood,
he was not repudiated by the Jews<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. Upon this
work was founded the Cabbalistic or mystical learning.</p>

<p>From these sources may be derived many Messianic
ideas and interpretations that were current among the
ancient Jews.</p>

<p>Of them I proceed to extract some, from the work
of Schöttgen, which may throw light upon the interior
system of the Homeric mythology in its most important
aspects.</p>

<p>1. First and foremost, these traditions appear to
bear witness to the extraordinary elevation of the
Messiah, and they fully recognise his title to the
great Tetragrammaton<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<p>2. Next, that introduction of the female principle
into the sphere of deity, which the Greeks seem to
have adopted, after their anthropophuistic manner, with
a view to the family order among the Immortals rather
than as a mere metaphysical conception, appears to
have its prototype in the Hebrew traditions.</p>

<p>When in the Holy Scriptures we find wisdom personified
in the feminine, we regard this only as a mode
of speech, though as one evidently tending to account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
for the sex of Minerva. But the Jewish traditions
went far beyond this<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. The two natures of our Lord
would appear from the Sohar to have been distinguished
under the figure of mother and daughter. The Schechina,
or ‘glory of God,’ is of the feminine gender: and
the relation of His divinity to His humanity is set
forth under the figure of a marriage. He is therefore
called mother and matron; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">temporibus futuris omnes
hostes tradentur in manus Matronæ</i>, as Schöttgen renders
the Sohar<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p>The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λόγος</span>, or Word of the Lord, is also shown to have
been, according to the genuine traditions of the Jews,
a common expression for the Messiah. The relation
thus exhibited is in marked analogy with that between
Minerva and Jupiter. This expression of the Targums
of Jonathan and Onkelos is also in correspondence
with the language of Philo, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Confusione Linguarum</span>,
pp. 255, 267<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.</p>

<p>4. The ideas of sonship and primogeniture<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> are
likewise recognised among the titles of the Messiah,
according to the Sohar and other Jewish authorities.
We shall have to inquire what Homeric deities there
are, who, by the distinction between their mode and
time of birth, and that of others, may appear to represent
these characteristics.</p>

<p>5. The Lord of Hosts, or Zebaoth<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, is another title
of the Messiah: and we may therefore expect, in any
traditionary remnant found elsewhere, to discover some
strong and commanding martial development.</p>

<p>6. The Messiah was preeminently conceived of by the
Jews as being the Light<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. This property is in imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>diate
connection with the idea of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λόγος</span>. It cannot
fail to be observed, how vividly such an idea is represented
in the ancient name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Φοῖβος</span> attaching to Apollo,
and probably also in that of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λυκηγένης</span> or ‘light-born.’
The same idea appears in the characteristic epithet
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γλαυκῶπις</span>, as it is now rightly interpreted, for Minerva.
This indeed is not merely an epithet, but it forms one
of her titles: as in Il. viii. 406.</p>

<p>7. Again, the name Metatron<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> is one of those properly
applied to the Messiah by the Jews. It is supposed
to have denoted originally the sense of the Latin
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">metator</i>, as having reference to the guiding of the
Israelites through the desert, and the marking or
measuring out of their camps there. But it appears to
have acquired afterwards the sense of Mediator, as implying
that the Messiah was the organ, through whom
the counsels of the Most High God took effect upon man.</p>

<p>8. The performance of miracles was to be a peculiar
mark of the Messiah<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.</p>

<p>9. Another was the conquest he was to achieve over
Satan, and the liberation of the dead from the grave
and from the power of hell<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>With these great gifts and powers was associated
an assemblage of the most winning and endearing
moral qualities. ‘The Schechina (or Messiah) is the
image of God; as He is gentle, so is She: as He is
gracious, so is She: as He is mighty, so is She mistress
over all nations: He is truth, She is faith: He the
prophet, She the prophetess: He the just, She the
just: He the king, She the queen: He wise, She
wisdom: He intelligent, She His intelligence: He the
crown, She the diadem<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The central idea of these old traditions, as we conceive
it, and as it stands apart from simple theism, was that
of redemption by means of a person clothed in the
attributions of humanity, but also invested with the nature
and powers of Godhead. Of these two sides of the
tradition, one was exhibited in the Word or Wisdom of
God, and the other in the Seed of the woman. The
first is appropriated to Minerva, and the second in the
main to Apollo. But as the divine and human could
not in the tradition long continue completely harmonized
and united, so neither are they wholly severed.
The Wisdom assumes a human configuration: the Seed
of the woman does not cease to be divine. Now Pallas
and Apollo preserve, relatively to one another, the
place of their prototypes in these two cardinal respects.
As the tradition of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λόγος</span> was more immediately
divine, so Pallas is more copiously invested with the
higher powers, prerogatives, and offices of deity. On the
other hand, as the deliverance was to be wrought out
by the immediate agency of the Seed of the woman, so
Apollo is more human, and is invested with the larger
and more varied assemblage of active endowments,
appertaining to the health, welfare, safety, purification,
and chastisement of mankind. And one main reason of
the anthropomorphous character of the Greek mythology
as a whole may very probably be found in the
fact, that it was an old and a pure tradition which
first gave to men the idea of God in human form; the
idea which, when once more purified, became that of
Emmanuel, God with us<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>The personages of the Homeric Theo-mythology who
might most reasonably be distinguished as having their
basis in tradition are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>


<ul><li>1. Jupiter.</li>
<li>2. Minerva.</li>
<li>3. Apollo.</li>
<li>4. Diana.</li>
<li>5. Latona.</li>
<li>6. Iris.</li>
<li>7. The Titans and kindred traditions.</li>
<li>8. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span>, the Temptress.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, Jupiter is so mixed a conception, and has
such important relations to the whole genesis of the
Greek mythology, that I place him in another class,
and postpone the attempt to give a view of his person
and offices until we have gone through the deities, in
whom the traditional element is less disguised and also
less contaminated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Minerva and Apollo the key.</i></div>

<p>And of these I commence with Minerva and Apollo,
not only because they are the most dignified, but also
as they are the most characteristic representatives of
the class, and because it is in their persons that we
may best test the amount and quality of the evidence
in support of the assertion, that a traditional basis for
the religion of the heroic age of Greece is still traceable
in the poems of Homer.</p>

<p>Again: it is the effect of this evidence in general
both to separate Minerva and Apollo by many important
differences from the general mass of the Olympian
deities, and likewise to associate them together in a
great number of common signs and properties.</p>

<p>For these reasons I shall begin by considering them
jointly: and I believe that in a just comprehension of
their position lies the key to the whole Homeric system.</p>

<p>The lines of description for these two deities will,
however, cross and recross one another. Their strong
and pervading essential resemblances do not preclude
much diversity of detail; and it will not unfrequently
be found to happen, either that a given sign, perhaps
even one of peculiar elevation, and thus of traditive
origin, is found in one of the two and not in the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
or else that such a sign is developed more fully in one
than in the other, or that the properties of an idea are
divided between them, as if it was felt that, where the
one was, the other must in greater or less measure be.</p>

<p>It will also be remembered that I do not aim at
including, even in this detailed discussion, all that is
ascribed by Homer to his Apollo and his Minerva;
but only at exhibiting, with such fulness and clearness
as I can, the distinctive character which on the whole
they may be said to possess in common, and which I
believe to constitute both the most curious, and by far
the most important feature of the whole Homeric Theo-mythology.</p>

<p>The signs which appear to mark these great deities
of tradition, and which accompany them with a deliberate
consistency through the poems, present themselves
with various bearings. Some affect their position
in the Olympian system, others their individual characters;
and lastly, a third class appertain to their dealings
with man, and to their place and power in regard
to the sphere of nature both animal and inanimate. Or
more briefly, we may regard them in their Olympian
relations, their personal characters, and their terrestrial
aspects. We will begin with the first of these three
divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their rank in the Olympian system.</i></div>

<p>1. Their position in the Olympian system, if we are
to adopt the common genesis of the Olympian system,
is one of hopeless and unaccountable solecism.</p>

<p>The gods of Olympus are arranged generally in two
generations. If we put Apollo and Minerva out of
view, then, with the exception of a deity like Dione, introduced
to serve as a mere vehicle of maternity, and inferior
in weight, if not in rank, to her own offspring, the
majesty and might of Olympus, following the order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
nature, are entirely in the elder of these generations, and
reside with Jupiter, Juno, Neptune, and Aidoneus or
Pluto. The greater spheres have been shared among
these divinities; nothing, except what is secondary, remains
for the rest. But the position of Apollo and Minerva
is in no respect inferior to those of the elder gods,
save Jupiter alone: in many points it is higher; it has
approximations to the very summit, which they have
not; nay, in particular points, Jupiter himself is exceeded.
It is so entirely different as a whole from that
of the other deities of the second generation, that we
must seek out a cause for the difference. Now it
cannot be made to depend, at least in the case of
Apollo, on the paramount magnitude of any one of his
functions, such as the bow, the lyre, or even the gift of
divination. It would have been natural to anticipate that
war, which is the business of Mars, might have made a
greater deity than divination, had both started from
the same point. In later times, perhaps, it did so; but
in Homer the inferiority of Mars is immeasurable. Now
if we cannot account for this and other cases of inferiority
to Apollo in the heroic age by function, we must,
I think, of necessity look for it in difference of origin.</p>

<p>2. Although the relation of Apollo and Minerva to
Jupiter places them in the generation next to his, (all
the Homeric divinities alike are subject to the condition
of being conceived to have a beginning,) yet there are
marked differences in antiquity between these two, and
all the other deities who, like them, stand as children to
Jupiter: while the simple fact, that they stand as his
children, is precisely what the ancient traditions would
have led us to expect, with a difference which we find
represented in the respective modes of their derivation
from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the other deities of the same generation, there
are some so recent, as Greek deities, that their childhood
is made matter of record: there is not one who
bears any mark that will throw him back to the period
when the Pelasgians ruled in Greece, like Jupiter as
the father of the old Hellic houses and the Dodonæan
worship, or Neptune as the parent of Neleus and of
Actor; or indeed that in any manner suggests great
antiquity. But now let us look at Minerva and Apollo.
That Minerva was born from the head of Jupiter, is a
legend which I apprehend signifies that, in the oldest
mythology, she had no mother: that, even if not in the
Olympian order, yet in the history of her worship she
was prior to Juno. She would otherwise have been
the daughter of Juno, or of some other mother; and
the sole parentage of Jupiter is a proof, that the tradition
she represented was in vogue before motherhood
among the Immortals was invented. So strictly is this
true, that, as the constructive process went on, a mother
was found for Minerva under the name of Metis<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>; who
was at the same time placed as the oldest among the
wives of Jupiter. In Homer, whether Tritogeneia is
to be interpreted head-born<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> or not, it is indubitable
that Minerva has no mother named, and is not the
child of any known female divinity: and the sole parentage
of Jupiter appears to be declared with sufficient
clearness in the expostulation of Mars to Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἐπεὶ αὐτὸς ἐγείναο παῖδ’ ἀΐδηλον.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is the only sense, so far as I can see, that can
properly be given to the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐτός</span>.</p>

<p>Apollo, on the other hand, is the son of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λήτω</span> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Latona. For her name there appears to be but one
satisfactory meaning, and it is this; that her origin was
before the memory of man, that is, before the period
within which the Greek mythological system had been
constructed.</p>

<p>It cannot fail to be remarked, that the relation
between the mythical origin of Apollo and that of
Minerva exhibit a difference entirely analogous to that
found in the traditions which they represent respectively;
and which would give to Apollo a mother, but
to Minerva none. In both, however, we may here
trace a strong resemblance to the Messianic traditions
of Holy Scripture and of the Jews.</p>

<p>3. These deities have a great variety of functions, of
which the secondary forms, or the executive applications,
are delegated to others, of less power and pre-eminence,
but still also in most cases strictly Olympian
gods. These satellite-divinities it may be convenient
to designate by the name of Secondaries.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Secondaries of Minerva.</i></div>

<p>The Secondaries of Olympus are so important a class,
that they deserve, as a class, a distinct consideration.</p>

<p>They are as follows:</p>

<p>First, for Minerva, in her great characters as goddess
of wisdom, of war, of polity, and of industrial art.</p>

<p>In the first, Mercury is her Secondary: for both are
presiding divinities or patrons of that calculating faculty
applied to conduct, which, on the side of virtue, reads
as prudence, and which in its degenerate form is craft
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κέρδεα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κερδοσύνη</span>).</p>

<p>In treating the god Mercury, with respect to this
capital particular, as a secondary of Minerva, I do not
mean that he is nothing else: but that the traditions
about Hermes were found capable of, and were allowed
to bear, such a form, that it is impossible to describe
fully the function of the one deity without including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
something that is also annexed to the other, or to draw
any clear line between them.</p>

<p>In later times Mercury at Athens was, according to
Müller<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, a Secondary also to Apollo, charged with the
exoteric and material parts of several among his functions.
And in Homer it seems probable, that his office
with respect to the dead ought to be viewed as ministerial
to that of Apollo.</p>

<p>In the next of her great offices, as goddess of war,
Mars is a Secondary to Minerva; and he is absolutely
nothing more. It may be enough in this place to refer
to what will be said of him in the next Section.</p>

<p>The Minerva of polity, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαοσσόος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγελείη</span>, and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐρυσιπτόλις</span>, is represented by Themis as a Secondary:
whose name betokens her character as a simple personification
of the idea of political and social rights,
reflected from earth upon the Olympian life.</p>

<p>In the last of the four functions, Vulcan is her Secondary.
It is true that the traditions do not exactly
square. He is something more, because he is the element
of fire, as well as the workman who operates by
it: and he is also something less, because he has no
concern with tissues, which fire has no share in creating,
and which in Greece, but not in Egypt<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, were exclusively
the business of women. But the relation between the
two is indisputable: nor is it less plain that in that relation
he fills, taken generally, the place of Olympian
workman, she of a presiding mind operating upon man.
And again, she is the goddess of construction; he has
relations only with one particular department of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Secondaries of Apollo.</i></div>

<p>Next for Apollo, in his characters, first, of the
Healer, and secondly, of the Bard, with that of the
Seer or Prophet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first of these he is, so to speak, assisted by a
pure Secondary, Paieon; who disappears from the later
and less refined Greek mythology, and is replaced by
an Æsculapius, reflected from the purely human Asclepius
of Homer. Paieon is a simply executive officer,
and exercises his gift, or as we should now say practises,
exclusively, as does Vulcan, except on special
occasions, for the benefit of the Olympian community;
while the original possession of the gift, and the power
of distributing it, is with Apollo.</p>

<p>There is a further and more subtle relation between
this deity and Apollo, indicated by the use of the name
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παιήων</span> for the hymn of victory<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. Whatever be the
ground of this usage, it supplies another point, in which
Paieon reflects Apollo the god of help, and so far tends
to exhibit Apollo as also the god of victory. Paieon
heals by the use of his hands, like an ordinary surgeon;
Apollo without personal presence, and without the use
of second causes, in answer to prayer<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>In the second of his great offices, the Muses are the
derivative deities, who conjointly form a Secondary
divinity to Apollo.</p>

<p>Their relation to him, and the combination in themselves
of the plural with the singular, are very curious.
His immediate concern is with the lyre, theirs with the
voice. They sometimes appear as one; for instance, in
the first verse of each of the poems: sometimes as
many; for instance, in the invocation before the Catalogue.
Even their action is so combined, that what at
one time they do as one, at others they do as many.
It is the Muses who maim Thamyris: it is the Muse,
who greatly loves Demodocus, who lays upon him the
burden of blindness, but endows him with the gift of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
song: and again, who instructs and loves the tribe of
Bards in general<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>The Muses are, with Homer, of Olympian rank; but
we can hardly deal with them as to many distinct impersonations:
or at least we must not follow out that idea to
its consequences. And for this reason; they were not
in contact with the popular mind, and formed no part of
the public religion: they were formations of the Poet
for his own purposes, whom he might make and unmake
at his will, and the conditions of whose existence
he might modify, without being bound to any further
degree of consistency than might for the occasion
answer the purpose of his art. We must not, then,
ask him whether he really means his Muse to be one
or many, and if many, how many (it is, indeed, only in
the second <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεκυΐα</span> that he mentions them as nine<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>), but
must simply take them as a poetical, rather than mythological,
impersonation of Vocal Music.</p>

<p>And here we at once perceive both the ground of
their plurality, and their ministerial relation to Apollo.
The former, probably, lay in the nature of harmony, or
simultaneous combination of tones, requiring, of course,
a combination of different voices, to effect what on the
instrument is done by different strings. And if it did not
spring from, it was at least suited to, that succession of
alternate parts, which was, as we know, used in Israel
even more anciently than in Homer’s time, and which
may, though I do not, for one, feel certain that it must,
have been signified by the term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμειβόμεναι</span>, a name
clearly relating to part-singing in one sense or another.
Their subordinate relation to Apollo is represented in
the combination<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> of the voice with the instrument. He,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
as the Original, remains in possession of the indivisible
gift: they assist him in one which is essentially distributive.
And as they share in his music, so also in his
knowledge: but only in that which relates to the past:
with the future they have no concern<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. But as either
Minerva or Vulcan can teach a smith, so either Apollo
or the Muse can inspire a bard<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Argument from the Secondaries.</i></div>

<p>Such then are the Olympian Secondaries. None of
them, it will be observed, are properly derivative beings.
All of them represent, in some sense, traditions, or imaginations,
distinct from those respecting their principal
deity: nor are they in the same kind of subservience
to them as the Eilithuiæ to Juno, who have no worship
paid them, and are of doubtful personality; or as the
metal handmaids to Vulcan himself. But they are
deities, each of whom singly in a particular province
administers a function, which also belongs to a deity of
higher dignity. And though a difference is clearly
discernible in the form of the possession and administration,
yet there still remains a clear and manifest duplication,
a lapping over of divinities, which is entirely
at variance with the symmetry that we might reckon
upon finding in an homogeneous conception of the
Greeks.</p>

<p>This irregular duplication is kept in some degree
out of view, if we set out with the determination to
refer the Homeric deities to a single origin, to make a
regular division of duties among them, and to pare
down this, or enlarge that, till we have brought them
and their supposed gifts into the requisite order. But
as it stands in Homer, free from later admixtures, and
from prepossessions of ours, it is a most curious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
significant fact, and raises at once a serious inquiry as
to its cause.</p>

<p>I submit that it may be referred to the joint operation
of two circumstances. First, to the particular
form of the early traditions that were incorporated
into the invented or Olympian system. Secondly, to
the principle of economy, or family and social order,
reflected back from the human community upon the
divine.</p>

<p>If the primitive tradition, even when disfigured by
the lapse of time, yet on its arrival in Greece still
visibly appropriated to one sublime person, distinguishable
from the supreme God, and femininely conceived,
the attributes of sovereign wisdom, strength, and skill;
and to another, in the form of man, the gifts of knowledge,
reaching before and after, and identified in early
times with that of Song, as well as that of healing or deliverance
from pain and death; then we can understand
why it is that, when these great personages take their
places as of right in the popular mythology, they continue
to keep hold on certain great functions, in which
their attributes are primarily developed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Picture of human society in Olympus.</i></div>

<p>But on the other hand, the divine society must be
cast into the form of the human; and this especially
must take effect in three great organic particulars. First,
by means of the family, which brings the members of
the body into being: secondly, by political association,
involving the necessity of a head, and of a deliberative
organ: thirdly, by the existence of certain professions,
which by the use of intellectual gifts provide for the
exigencies of the community. The merely labouring
classes, in whose place and idea there is nothing of the
governing function, are naturally without representation,
in the configuration of the divine community, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the forms of their particular employments: though the
people at large bear a rude analogy to the mass of inferior
deities not included in the ordinary meeting of
the gods, yet summoned to the great Chapter or Parliament.
Olympus must, in short, have its <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημιόεργοι</span>.</p>

<p>Who these were for an ordinary Greek community
like that of Ithaca, we learn from the speech of Eumæus<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

       <div class="verse indent12">τῶν οἳ δημιοεργοὶ ἔασιν,</div>
       <div class="verse">μάντιν, ἢ ἰητῆρα κακῶν, ἢ τέκτονα δούρων,</div>
       <div class="verse">ἢ καὶ θέσπιν ἀοιδόν.</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Here, indeed, there is no representation of the principle
of gain or commerce, which does not appear as yet to
have formed a class in Greece, though the Ithacans habitually
sacrificed to Mercury<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. But that formation
was on the way; for the class was already known,
doubtless as a Phœnician one, under the name of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρηκτῆρες</span>, men of business, apt to degenerate into
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρωκταὶ</span>, or sharpers. Nor was there a class of soldiers;
but every citizen became a soldier upon occasion. With
these additions, it is curious to observe how faithfully the
Olympian copy is modelled upon the human original.
The five professions, or demioergic functions, are,</p>


<ul><li>1. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάντις</span>, the seer.</li>
<li>2. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰήτηρ κακῶν</span>, the surgeon.</li>
<li>3. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέκτων δούρων</span>, the skilled artificer.</li>
<li>4. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀοιδὸς</span>, the bard.</li>
<li>5. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρήκτηρ</span>, the man of business or merchant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now all these were actually represented in Apollo
and Minerva; the first, second, and fourth by Apollo,
the third and fifth by Minerva, who was also the
highest type of war. But this union of several human
professions in one divine person would have been fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to the fidelity and effectiveness of the Olympian picture,
to which a division of labour, analogous to the division
existing in actual society, was essential. Therefore the
accumulation was to be reduced. And in order to make
this practicable, there were distinct traditions ready, on
which could be laid the superfluous or most easily
separable attributes of Apollo and Minerva. So Apollo
keeps unimpaired his gift of foreknowledge, and Minerva
hers of sublime wisdom. With these no one is
permitted to interfere. But the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰήτηρ</span> is represented in
Paieon: the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέκτων</span> (into Olympus however no inferior
material enters, and all work is evidently in metal, of
which the celestial Smith<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> constructs the buildings
themselves, that on earth would be made of wood) is
exhibited in Vulcan: the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀοιδὸς</span> in the Muses, the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρήκτηρ</span> in Mercury, and the man of war in Mars.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dignity and precedence of Minerva.</i></div>

<p>3. Though Minerva cannot contest with Juno the honour
of mere precedence in the Olympian court, yet, as
regards substantial dignity, she by no means yields even
to the queen of heaven. Sometimes, undoubtedly,
when she moves in the interest of the Greeks, it is upon
the suggestion of Juno made to herself, as in Il. i. 195;
or through Jupiter, as in Il. iv. 64. But it is probable
that this should be referred, not to greater eminence or
authority, but simply to the more intensely and more
narrowly Hellenized character of Juno. There are,
at any rate, beyond all doubt, some arrangements
adopted by the poet, with the special intent, to all
appearance, of indicating a full equality, if not an
actual pre-eminence, for Minerva. Twice the two
goddesses descend together from Olympus to the field
of battle. Both times it is in the chariot of Juno.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Now Iris, as on one occasion, at least, she acts at
Juno’s bidding, and as on another we find her unyoking
the chariot of Mars, might with propriety have been
employed to discharge this function at a moment when
the two greatest goddesses are about to set out together.
It is not so, however. Juno herself yokes the horses,
and also plays the part of driver, while Minerva
mounts as the warrior beside her<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. To be the charioteer
is generally, though not quite invariably, the
note of the inferior. But irrespectively of this official
distinction, Minerva with her Ægis is the conspicuous,
and Juno evidently the subordinate figure in the group.</p>

<p>In the Odyssey, again, we have a most striking indication
of the essential superiority of Minerva to the
great and powerful Neptune. Attending, in the disguise
of a human form, the sacrifice of Nestor at Pylos
to his divine ancestor, she does not scruple, on the invitation
of the young prince Pisistratus, to offer prayer to
that deity, in the capacity of a courteous guest and a religious
Greek. Her petitions are for Nestor, for his
family, for his subjects, and for the errand on which
she, with Telemachus, was engaged. All are included
in the general words with which she concludes<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent22">μηδὲ μεγήρῃς</div>
       <div class="verse">ἡμῖν εὐχομένοισι τελευτῆσαι τάδε ἔργα.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But at the close the poet goes on to declare that
what she thus sought in prayer from her uncle Neptune,
she forthwith accomplished herself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὣς ἄρ’ ἔπειτ’ ἠρᾶτο, καὶ αὐτὴ πάντα τελεύτα.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Yet once more. The same train of ideas, which
explains how Olympus is fitted with a set of Seconda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>ries,
also shows to us why these Secondaries have only
the lower or subsidiary form of their several gifts. It
is because these gifts were already in the possession of
higher personages, before the introduction of the more
recent traditions represented by the Secondaries: traditions,
of which the whole, (except that of Paieon, who is
not worshipped at all, and exists only in and for Olympus,)
bear upon them, as received in Greece, the marks
of modernism<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. They naturally submit to the conditions,
anterior to themselves, of the hierarchy into which
they are introduced. But, on the one hand, their existence,
together with the peculiar relation of their work
and attributes, rather than themselves, to the great
deities of tradition, Apollo and Minerva, constitutes of
itself a strong argument for the separate and more
ancient origin of those divinities. On the other hand,
they bear powerful testimony to the force of that principle,
which reflected on the Achæan heaven the experience
of earth. For there is not a single dignified and
intellectual occupation known to and in use among the
Hellenic tribes, properly so called, which has not, as far
as may be, counterpart on Olympus. Not even the priesthood
is a real exception; especially if I am right in
believing it to be Pelasgian, and not yet to have been
adopted in the time of Homer as one of the Hellenic institutions.
But, even if it had been so adopted, it could not,
from the nature of the case, have been carried into the
Olympian system, since there were no beings above
themselves to whom the gods could offer sacrifice, and
since, according to the depraved idea of it which had
begun to prevail, in offering it they would have parted
with something that was of value to themselves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not hear a great deal respecting mere ceremonial
among the Olympian divinities. To Jupiter, however,
and to Juno, is awarded the conspicuous honour,
that, when either of them enters the assembled Court,
all the other deities rise up<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. It is plain that Homer
included in the picture before his mental eye ideas
relating to that external order which we term precedence:
and it may be shown, that Minerva had the precedence
over the other gods, or what we should term
the seat of honour; that place which was occupied, in
the human family, by the eldest son. Juno we must
presume, as the reflection of Jupiter, would occupy the
place of the mother.</p>

<p>When Thetis is summoned to Olympus in the
Twenty-fourth Iliad, she receives on her arrival the
honours of a guest, in which is included this distinguished
place beside the chief person, and it is Minerva
who yields it up to her;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἡ δ’ ἄρα πὰρ Διῒ πατρὶ καθέζετο, εἶξε δ’ Ἀθήνη<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.</div>
</div></div>

<p>An exactly similar proceeding is recorded in the
Third Odyssey. When Telemachus and the pseudo-Mentor
approach the banquet of Nestor, Pisistratus,
the youngest son, first goes to greet them, and then
places them in the seat of honour, between his father
and his eldest brother<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">πάρ τε κασιγνήτῳ Θρασυμήδεϊ καὶ πατέρι ᾧ·</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>that is, by the side of Nestor; Thrasymedes giving
way to make room for them, and remaining on the
other side of them, like Minerva in the Twenty-Fourth
Iliad.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of Apollo.</i></div>

<p>Homer has left no express record on this particular
point with reference to Apollo. In the ancient Hymn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
however, a part of which is quoted by Thucydides, this
honour is distinctly assigned to that divinity in these
fine lines<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὅν τε θεοὶ κατὰ δῶμα Διὸς τρομέουσιν ἰόντα·</div>
       <div class="verse">καί ῥάτ’ ἀναΐσσουσιν ἐπισχέδον ἐρχομένοιο</div>
       <div class="verse">πάντες ἀφ’ ἑδράων, ὅτε φαίδιμα τόξα τιταίνει.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Intimacy of their relations with Jupiter.</i></div>

<p>4. More remarkable and important, however, than
this precedence of Minerva in the Olympian Court, are
the relations of will and affection between Jupiter and
these two, as compared with his other children.</p>

<p>To these, and these only, does he ever use any term
of positive endearment. Minerva is twice called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φίλον τέκος</span>, and Apollo is twice addressed in the
vocative as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φίλε Φοῖβε</span><a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. This is the more worthy
of note, because it might have been expected that
other divinities rather than these, for example, Mercury
on account of his youth, or Venus for her beauty
and blandishments, would have been the preferable
objects of these phrases. But there is nothing of the
sort in the case of Mercury, and in that of Venus, the
nearest approach is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέκνον ἐμόν</span> (Il. v. 428). She is only
addressed as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φίλον τέκος</span> by Juno, who was not her
mother, and this at a moment when it was convenient
to pass a gross deception upon her<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<p>Minerva is, indeed, sufficiently forward to place herself
in opposition to Jupiter for purposes of her own:
she does not exhibit the principle of full obedience, but
then she is strong in the self-consciousness of right as well
as in power. She goes all lengths in thwarting Jupiter
in the Iliad, excites his wrath, and draws down on herself
his menaces<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. But her general aim is to give effect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
a design so unequivocally approved in Olympus, that
Jupiter himself has been constrained to give way to it;
namely, the vindication of justice by the fall of Troy.
And consequently, upon the slightest indication from
her of a conciliatory disposition, Jupiter shows himself
appeased, and seems to regret his own rigour<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

<p>The case of Apollo stands alone as an exhibition of
entire harmony with the will of Jupiter. On no single
occasion does he act or speak in a different sense from
that of his parent. In the Olympian Council of the
Twenty-Fourth Iliad, having to make a strong remonstrance
respecting the dishonoured condition of the
body of Hector, he is careful to address it not to
Jupiter, but to the body of gods present<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">σχέτλιοί ἐστε, θεοὶ, δηλήμονες.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And consequently, when Juno follows with a sharp
invective aimed at him, Jupiter immediately checks
her<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>, and gives effect to the counsel of Apollo. Generally
throughout the poem he is the organ of Jupiter
for all that is about to be effected on behalf of Troy,
but never for any purpose which is to prove abortive.
When, under the divine decree, Hector is about to be
slain by Achilles, Apollo withdraws from the doomed
warrior, and Minerva joins the favoured one.</p>

<p>This union of the will of Apollo with that of Jupiter
must not be lightly passed by. It is in truth one of
the very strongest arguments to show the presence of
traditionary elements in this great conception. For
wide as is the prevalence of the law of discord upon
earth, that evil is hardly less rife in Olympus. Not
only do menaces form the supreme sanction by which
in many cases its government is carried on, but every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
kind of personal grudge and quarrel abounds, as well
as a general tendency to intrigue and insubordination.
So that it does not sound strange to us, when Jupiter
uses to his son Mars what nevertheless upon examination
we must allow to be an astonishing expression;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἔχθιστος δέ μοί ἐσσι θεῶν, οἳ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Among all the rest of the prominent divinities, there
is no single instance of a positive harmony of will pervading
the whole course of action, either as between
any one of them and Jupiter, or as among themselves.
I therefore take it as a very strong indication that
materials were brought for this tradition, so different in
kind from what Olympus yielded, out of a source higher
than Olympus.</p>

<p>5. In the point next to be stated Apollo is chiefly
concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Apollo the deliverer of heaven.</i></div>

<p>It is the remarkable tradition, which makes that
god the defender and deliverer of heaven and the
other Immortals.</p>

<p>Otus and Ephialtes, twin grandchildren of Neptune,
and the most huge in stature of all beings reared on
earth, as also the most beautiful after Orion, threaten
even in their boyhood war against heaven, and propose to
scale it by piling the mountains. And this they would
have accomplished, had they attained to their proper age
and full size (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἥβη</span>): but Apollo destroyed them first<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p>This is a tradition which cannot properly belong to
Greek invention: for what has Apollo to do, when so
regarded, either with the wielding of vast physical
force, or with laying it prostrate? Neither as physician,
harper, poet, prophet, archer, nor angel of Death, does
he appear to have been the person who would have
been chosen for this purpose. The thunderbolt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Jupiter is the weapon we should have expected to be
employed in preference, or the mighty spear and terrifying
Ægis of Minerva, or even the brute bulk of Mars.
The gentle death, which it was Apollo’s mythological
office to bring about, is totally unsuited to the subject.</p>

<p>It is only when we expand that mild conception into
the character of the Avenger, partially exhibited in
the First Iliad, that Apollo becomes the fitting destroyer
of Otus and Ephialtes. This tradition in aftertimes
was apparently combined with a larger one relating
to the Giants, at which Homer darkly glances<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p>Ovid makes Jupiter his own defender<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>: a fine passage
in Horace introduces many divine combatants, but
retains a rather prominent place for Apollo, while it
gives another to Minerva; and these two with Jupiter
appear to bear the brunt of the battle<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

<p>It admits of but one satisfactory explanation, namely
that, coming from a source higher than the mythology,
it does not, so to speak, wear the livery of that system:
and that this performance is assigned to Apollo, either
because he represented the Person to whom all power
was to belong in heaven and earth both for destruction
and for deliverance, or else because tradition actually
assigned to that same Person the glory of having already
overcome a rebellion of powerful beings against the
Most High.</p>

<p>There is no precise parallel supplied by Homer, in
the case of Minerva, to the tradition which makes
Apollo the destroyer of the rebels. But though not
the defender of the divine order at large, she is the
champion of Hercules, the favourite son of Jupiter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
under circumstances when apparently, but for her, his
divinity would have been at fault. ‘What!’ says
Minerva, when thwarted by her parent in the Eighth
Iliad, ‘has he forgotten how many times I saved his
son in the labours imposed upon him by Eurystheus?
Had I, at the time when Hercules was sent by him to
fetch Cerberus out of the under-world, known how he
would behave now, never should he have escaped the
dread streams of Styx<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.’ We are left to infer from this
curious legend that Minerva had a power, available
in the world below, which tradition did not assign to
Jupiter, and that he found her use of it on this occasion
absolutely indispensable for the fulfilment of his wishes,
even in regard to a favourite son.</p>

<p>Each of these functions, assigned to Apollo and
Minerva respectively, recalls to memory those Jewish
traditions, which set forth the direct and especial power
of the Messiah over the fallen angels and over the
grave.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>These deities are never foiled by others.</i></div>

<p>6. The last characteristic of the two peculiarly traditive
deities which will be mentioned under this head
is, that they are never foiled, defeated, or outwitted by
any other of the gods. In no single case has Minerva,
where she is in action, to encounter any one of these
forms of dishonour: nor has Apollo, in any instance except
only when he is pitted against Minerva. Of this
class there are two cases: one, when the Greeks are
losing ground<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>, and he is made to arrange with her for
stopping the general conflict, by prompting the personal
challenge from Hector in its stead: a matter which was
certain to end to the credit of the Greeks. The other is
in the Doloneia<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, when he causes an alarm just in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to find that Diomed and Ulysses, guided by Minerva,
have accomplished the bloody purpose of their errand.
Among men, as among gods, Minerva touches nothing
except what is destined to triumph. She is not, therefore,
invoked by the doomed Patroclus: and she renders
him no aid.</p>

<p>To appreciate the importance of this consideration,
we must bear in mind that there is no one of the purely
invented deities, who is not at one time or another
subject in some form to disparagement. Mars is
worsted by Minerva, through Diomed, as well as directly
subject to her control; Vulcan is laughed at by the
gods in general; Mercury dares not encounter Latona;
Ceres sees her lover slain by Jupiter; Venus is not
only smitten to the ground by Minerva, but beaten by
Diomed without his having any divine aid to strengthen
him, and befooled by Juno; Juno outwits Jupiter
himself; but Juno also, together with Aides, is wounded
sorely by Hercules; and it is also recorded of her, that
she had been subjected by her husband to the ignominious
punishment of hanging in chains, with an anvil
at each foot<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.</p>

<p>Neptune is no where subjected to personal ignominy;
but he is baffled by Laomedon, and is also unable
to avenge effectually the mutilation of his son Polyphemus.
Nay, Jupiter himself, besides being deceived by
Juno, was menaced by a formidable combination, who
were about to put him in fetters, when Briareus came
to his aid<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Apollo arrests with sudden shock
the victorious career of Diomed<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, and again of Patroclus<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.
And in the destinies of Ulysses, Minerva, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
protects him, effectually, though after a struggle, prevails
against Neptune, who does his uttermost against
him. In order, however, justly to estimate the weight
of this consideration, we must not omit to notice, that
it has cost Homer an elaborate, and what we might
otherwise call a far-fetched contrivance<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, to save Apollo
from dishonour in the Theomachy. He is there
matched against Neptune, a deity of rank equal to
that of Jupiter, and in force inferior to his elder brother
alone. It was therefore inadmissible that such a god
should be subjected to defeat. But if Apollo were no
more than one of the ordinary deities of invention, no
similar reason could apply to him. He was junior: he
was a son of Jupiter, like Mars or Mercury: he was
on the losing side, that of the Trojans: why should he
not, like Mars, be well thrashed by his antagonist? It
could only be, I think, in consequence of some broad
line of demarcation between them: some severance
which determines their characters and positions as
radically and fundamentally, and not by mere accident,
divided.</p>

<p>If we consider the mere birth of these two deities
according to the Olympian order, every consideration
derived from that source would tend to assign to Mars
a higher place than Apollo. His function was more
commanding: for in an age of turbulence, and among a
people given alike to freebooting and to open war, what
pacific office could compete, abstractedly, with that of
the god of arms? Again, Mars is the son of Juno, who is
the eldest daughter of Saturn, the original and principal
wife of Jupiter, the acknowledged queen of Olympus:
the coequal in birth of the great trine brotherhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and second in power to none but Jupiter himself.
Why should the child of Latona be placed so far above
the child of one so much his superior in birth, according
to the mythological order? Why is his position so
different from that enjoyed by the child of Dione, or
the child of Ceres?</p>

<p>But so studiously does Homer cherish the dignity of
Apollo, that he does not even throw on him the burden
of taking the initiative in proposing the plan by which
it is to be saved. This is managed with great care and
art. ‘Let us two fight,’ says Neptune, ‘but do you
begin, as I am the older, and know better.’ And
then, by bringing up their common grudge against
Laomedon, he proceeds to show of what absurdity
Apollo would be guilty if he were to follow the ironical
advice, and thus makes it easy, indeed inevitable,
for him to echo the sentiment, and say, let us leave
them, hapless mortals, to themselves.</p>

<p>With this we may compare two other arrangements
conceived in the same spirit. In the Fifteenth Iliad,
Jupiter takes care that the mission of Apollo to assist
the Trojans shall only begin when Neptune, the formidable
friend of the Greeks, has already quitted the field
of battle<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. And in the Fifth Odyssey, it is contrived
that only when Neptune withdraws from the persecution
of Ulysses, then at length Minerva shall instantly
appear to resume her charge over him<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.</p>

<p>When we come to discuss the position of Latona,
both generally and in the Theomachy, further force will,
I think, be added to the foregoing considerations. On
the other hand, I admit that the legend of Apollo with
Laomedon, which represents that he and Neptune were
deceived by that king, is not, so far as I see, explained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
any manner which should place it in entire harmony
with the general rule we have been considering, unless
we may consider that he had his revenge in the opportunity
afforded him by the Theomachy of refusing to
fight for Troy. But this is a case of treatment by a
mortal, not by a god; and it belongs to a different order.</p>

<p>I now proceed to touch upon the pre-eminence of
Minerva and Apollo in points connected with their
terrestrial relations, and with what may be termed the
physical conditions of their existence.</p>

<p>1. It is quite clear from Homer, that these two
deities received from men a special and peculiar
honour: though it may be open to question, whether
this retained only the indeterminate form of a sentiment,
or whether it was embodied in some fact or usage.</p>

<p>Pallas and Apollo have the exclusive distinction of
being invoked in conjunction with Jupiter, in the remarkable
line</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">Αἲ γὰρ, Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This verse meets us, not upon occasions having reference
to any peculiar rite or function, but simply when
the speaker desires to give utterance with a peculiar
solemnity or emphasis to some strong and paramount
desire. Thus Agamemnon wishes, with this adjuration,
that he had ten such counsellors as Nestor<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>: and again,
that all his warriors had the same activity of spirit as
the two Ajaxes<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. Nestor with these words wishes
himself young again<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>: as does old Laertes<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. Achilles
prays in this form, when exasperated, for the destruction
of Greeks and Trojans alike<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>: Menelaus
for the appearance of Ulysses among the Suitors<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>;
Alcinous thus expresses the wish that Ulysses could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
be the husband of Nausicaa<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>: and lastly, Telemachus,
that the Suitors were in a worse condition than the
disabled Irus<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Trine Invocation.</i></div>

<p>The expression never is heard from the mouth of any
Trojan; for Homer, on whatever account, rarely allows
them the use of the same formulæ with the Greeks.
But the whole substance of it is contained, and in a
shape even more restrictive, in the line twice spoken
by Hector,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">Τιοίμην δ’, ὡς τιέτ’ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Απόλλων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This language is indeed so pointed, that it suggests
the question, whether there must not have been some
peculiar form of external honour, which in the Heroic
age was rendered to these deities, and not to others.</p>

<p>And, singularly enough, of the temples of the Homeric
poems, all that we can point out as unequivocally
named, and in existence, are temples either to
Apollo or to Pallas. But the phrases may also have
pointed towards others of their very numerous distinctions.
I do not, accordingly, venture to assert that this
actually was the exclusive honour of the two deities;
but there is nothing absurd in the supposition that it
may have been so. It would not have been inconsistent
with a belief in Jupiter as the highest god, that those,
who were believed to be in a peculiar sense his ministers
and organs for the government of the world, should
either have received at the hands of mankind a larger
share of the substantial tributes of worship than he did,
or should have enjoyed it under a peculiar form and
conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their worship universal.</i></div>

<p>2. It would appear to be indubitable, that Apollo
and Minerva were objects not of partial but of universal
worship, within the sphere of the knowledge of Homer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Even without examination of details, the proof of
this proposition might rest upon their relative positions
in regard to the two parties of Greeks and Trojans.
Minerva, the great Hellenizing deity, is the object of
the supplicatory procession of Trojan women in the
Sixth Book. She is the peculiar patroness at once of
the highly Pelasgian Attica<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>, and of the characteristic
type of Hellenic character represented in Ulysses.
On the other hand, Apollo, the one really effective
champion of the Trojans, is acknowledged by every
Greek chieftain, except Agamemnon, at the very outset
of the poem<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. Agamemnon himself has only been misled
by his own avarice and passion, and he shortly sends a
solemn mission to appease the offended divinity<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.</p>

<p>Setting aside the case of Jupiter, who stands on a
different level, there is nothing attaching to the other
deities of the War, which at all resembles the position
of command enjoyed in common by these two, both
among their friends, and with those against whom they
are contending. There is not even a difference of
degree to be traced between the reverence paid them
on the one side, and on the other.</p>

<p>When we turn to particulars, we find that Minerva
has a temple in Troy, a temple in Athens, a sacred
grove in Scheria. She is worshipped by Nestor on the
sea-shore at Pylos, and, near the Minyeius; by Telemachus
in Ithaca; by Ulysses and Diomed in the Greek
camp. She accompanies Ulysses every where, while he
is within the circle of the Greek traditions; only refrains
of her own free will from going beyond it; and rejoins
him when, near Scheria, he has at length again touched
upon the outermost border of the Greek world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no deity, without excepting even Jupiter,
with respect to whom we have such ample evidence in
the poems of the development of his worship in
positive and permanent institutions, as is given in the
case of Apollo. He has a priest at Chryse, a temple in
Troy, a priest and grove at Ismarus in Thrace, a grove
and festivals in Ithaca, oracles at Delos and at Delphi.</p>

<p>Besides these positive institutions, there are in Homer
innumerable marks of his influence. He worked for
Laomedon, he is worshipped at Cille; the name of
Lycia seems to have been probably derived from him
and his attributes; the Seers, whom he endows with
vision, are found in Peloponnesus, and even among the
Cyclops; he feeds the horses of Admetus either in
Pieria or in Pheræ, claims the services of Alcyone, the
daughter of Marpessa, in Ætolia, and slays the children
of Niobe near mount Sipylus. So far as the Homeric
signs go, they would lead us to suppose that he was
regarded by the Poet as a deity no less universal than
that Scourge of Death, to which he stands in such a
close and solemn relation.</p>

<p>With the exception of Jupiter, there is no other
deity of whom we can so confidently assert that he
receives an universal worship: and Neptune is the only
other, with Minerva, in regard to whom the indications
of the poems render it probable. Of him we may infer
it, from his appearing to be known or to act at places
so widely separated by distance; on the Solyman mountains,
in Troas under Laomedon, in Greece near the
Enipeus, in the land of the Cyclops, in the sea far
north of Phæacia. But this is entirely owing to the wide
extent of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάλασσα</span>, his portion of the great kingdom
of external Nature, which, being as broad as the
Phœnician traditions of the Odyssey, at once gives him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
a place in them. It is clearly not due to any thing
more divine in the conception of him, for he carries
many chief notes of limitation in common with the
divinities of pure invention.</p>

<p>The wide extension of the class of Seers may of
itself be taken as a proof of the equally wide recognition
of the influence of Apollo: for he it was who made
Polypheides<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> to be first of that order, on the death of
Amphiaraus. Now these Seers appear to have been
found every where, under the form either of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάντις</span>,
or of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰωνίστης</span>. Not in Greece only and in Troas
proper; but in Percote, among the Mysians, and even
among the Cyclops in the Outer Zone<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Not localized as to abode.</i></div>

<p>3. The next distinction I shall note in the traditive
deities is, that they are confined to no one spot or region
for their abode; a limitation, which is imposed,
either more or less, upon every other prominent deity
except Jupiter only.</p>

<p>With respect to some of them, this is made quite
clear by positive signs. Except when in Olympus, or
else when abroad on a special occasion, Mars does not
quit Thrace, nor Vulcan Lemnos, nor Venus Paphos.
But even upon higher and older deities there are signs
of some kind of local limitation. The rigidly Argeian
character of Juno, though it does not express, yet implies
it. Demeter would appear to have a local abode,
probably in Crete. Aidoneus and Persephone are ordinarily
confined to the Shades, where their proper
business lies. Neptune himself, when dismissed from the
battle-field, is desired to repair either to the sea or to
Olympus. His regular worship among the Greeks was,
as appears from a speech of Juno, at Helice and Ægæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in Ægialos; which it is not easy to account for, except
upon the supposition that he resided peculiarly at these
places<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. Now it is expressly declared that his palace
was in Ægæ: from thence he sets out for the plain of
Troy, and thither he repairs when he desists from the
persecution of Ulysses. The name Ægæ is not mentioned
in the Catalogue, and Helice, as it is called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐρεῖα</span>, was evidently a district; thus it may have been
the district in which Ægæ stood, perhaps as its seaport<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.
Before the time of Strabo Ægæ<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> had disappeared.</p>

<p>Now Minerva has a peculiar relation to Athens, and
is once mentioned as betaking herself thither<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. Again,
the epithet <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λυκηγένης</span>, rarely given to Apollo, has suggested
a connection with Lycia. If, however we form
our judgment from Homer, Lycia may derive its name
from Apollo, but not Apollo from Lycia.</p>

<p>But it is plain from the poems that the influence, the
activity, and the virtual, if not positive presence of
Apollo and Minerva pervade the whole Homeric world.
This is shown partly by their universal action; in Troas,
in Lycia<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>, in Thrace, in Scheria, and all over Greece. It
is also demonstrated by the manner in which prayer is
addressed to them: and neither the one nor the other
is ever represented either as having a palace or residence
in any particular spot, or as showing, like Juno,
an exclusive partiality to any particular race or city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Although invocation of divinities is frequent in
the poems of Homer, it does not seem to have been
sufficiently observed, that the Olympian personages,
to whom it is ordinarily addressed, are very few in
number.</p>

<p>In the Twentieth Odyssey, Penelope beseeches Diana
to put a period to her mournful existence. I presume
that she is here invoked, not on account of her superiority
as a traditive deity, but because the subject is
connected with her especial office in regard to Death.</p>

<p>Neptune again is occasionally addressed by mortals;
as by his descendant Nestor on the sea-shore at Pylus,
and in like manner by his son Polyphemus, on the
beach of the country of the Cyclops. So also he is invoked
by the Envoys on their way to the encampment
of Achilles: here again their course lies along the sea-shore.
I will assume accordingly, though with a good
deal of doubt, that any Olympian deity might be made
the object of supplication under given circumstances of
time, place, or person. But it is manifest from the
poems that the general rule is the other way. They
are ordinarily not made the subjects of invocation, even
in connection with their own peculiar gifts. There is
no invocation addressed in Homer to Venus, Mars,
Mercury, or Vulcan; nor even, which is more remarkable,
to Juno.</p>

<p>Prayer however is very usual in the poems: but it is
confined to three divinities only.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Objects of habitual prayer.</i></div>

<p>Jupiter, Apollo, and Pallas are addressed by persons
in difficulty, not with reference to any peculiar gift or
office that they fill, but quite independently of peculiar
rites, and local or personal relations. Thus Ulysses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Diomed in the Doloneia invoke Minerva<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. Menelaus,
when about to attack Euphorbus, prays first to Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.
Nestor, too, addresses Jupiter, and not his own ancestor
Neptune<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>, in the great straits of the Greek army.
Glaucus beseeches Apollo to heal his wound<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>; and if
this address be thought to belong to his medical function,
it is still very remarkable from its containing a
direct assertion, that he is able both to hear and to
act at whatever distance. The same may be said of
the prayer of Pandarus<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. His priest Chryses offers
prayer to him from the plain of Troas (Il. i. 37): but
this may be incidental to the office. The cases of
prayer to Jupiter and Minerva are purely private petitions,
without notice, suggested by the circumstances
of the moment: and they show that though Homer
had perhaps no abstract idea of omnipresence, he assigned
to these deities its essential characteristic, that
is to say, the possession of powers not limited by space.</p>

<p>The evidence that Apollo was invoked independently
of bodily presence at a particular spot, and for the
general purpose of help and protection, not simply in
the exercise of particular mythological functions, if it
be less diversified is still, I think, not less conclusive.
It is, in the first place, supplied by the trine invocation
repeatedly addressed to him together with Jupiter and
Minerva<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>But the general capacity of Apollo, like Minerva, to
receive prayer, is demonstrated by the language of
Diomed to Hector in the Eleventh Book, when Apollo
was not on the battlefield (363, 4); ‘for this time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Phœbus Apollo has delivered you: and doubtless you
took care to pray to him, when you ventured within
the clang of spears:’</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>5. We may now pass on to another head of special
prerogatives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Exempt from appetite and limitations.</i></div>

<p>Both Minerva and Apollo are generally exempt from
the physical limitations, and from the dominion of
appetite, to which the deities of invention are as generally
subject. Though, when a certain necessity is
predicated of the gods in general, they may be literally
included within it, we do not find that the Poet had
them in his eye apart from the rest, and the particular
liabilities and imperfections are never imputed to either
of them individually. What is said of them inclusively
with others, is in reality not said of them at all,
but only of the prevailing disposition of the body to
which they belong: just as we are told in the Iliad
(xi. 78), that all the gods were incensed with Jupiter
because of his bias towards the Trojans, when we know
that it was in reality only some among them, of the
greatest weight and power. Neither Apollo nor Minerva
eats, or drinks, or sleeps, or is wearied, or is wounded, or
suffers pain, or is swayed by passion. Neither of them
is ever outwitted or deluded by any deity of invention,
as Venus is, and even as Jupiter is, by Juno in
the Fourteenth Iliad. When Minerva, in the shape of
Mentor, receives the cup in the Pylian festivities, she
passes it on to Telemachus, but it is not stated that
she drinks of it<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. With this compare the meal of
Mercury on the island of Calypso<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>, the invitation to
Iris to join in the banquet of the Winds, and her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
fear lest she should lose her share of the Ethiopian
hecatombs<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>


<p>Their relations to animal sacrifice are different from
those of the other, at least of the inventive, gods.
Apollo, indeed, is charged by Juno with having attended
at the marriage of Thetis together with the
rest of the gods, where they all banqueted<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>;</p>

       <div class="verse">δαίνυ’ ἔχων φόρμιγγα·</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and in the Third Odyssey Minerva comes to attend the
gracious sacrifice of Nestor offered in her honour<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>,</p>

<p>Chryses pleads the performance of the sacrificial rites,
as one ground of favour with the god<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>: in which, however,
he is, after all, only showing that he has not
failed to discharge the positive obligations of his office.
And of course these two were the objects of sacrifice
like other deities. Had they not been so, the fact
would have been in conflict with their traditional
origin, instead of sustaining it. They stand in the
same category with the rest of the Olympian company,
in that sacrifice is acceptable to them all: but first, it
is plain that they are never said to take a sensual pleasure
in it; and secondly, it does not appear that their
favour to individuals either was founded upon it, or
when lost could be recovered by it. It is restitution,
and not sacrifice, which is sought and demanded in the
case of Chryses. The moral character of the whole of
those proceedings is emphatically and authoritatively
declared by Calchas<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">οὔτ’ ἄρ’ ὅγ’ εὐχωλῆς ἐπιμέμφεται, οὔθ’ ἑκατόμβης·</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So Diomed and Ulysses have the closest personal rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>tions
with Minerva; but are nowhere said to have acquired
their place in her good-will by sacrifices: though
both Apollo for Hector, and Minerva for Ulysses, plead
in the Olympian court, before the other gods, the sacrificial
bounty of those heroes respectively<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. Nor do we
here rest wholly upon negative evidence. In the First
Book, the sacrifice of the Greeks to Apollo, by the
hands of Chryses, is described in the fullest detail: and
the Poet tells us what it was that the god did take
delight in; it was the refined pleasure of the mind and
ear, afforded to him by the songs they chanted before
him all the day in his honour: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ δὲ φρένα τέρπετ’
ἀκούων</span><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. Further, the contrast may be drawn not
with divinities of their own generation only, but with
the long journeys of Neptune<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> for a feast, and with the
marked and apparently unvarying language of Jupiter
himself.</p>

<p>They receive sacrifice with a dignity, which does not
belong to the other deities. When prayer and offerings
are presented to Jupiter by the Greeks, and he
means to refuse the prayer, it is added, that he notwithstanding
took the sacrifices<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἀλλ’ ὅγε δέκτο μὲν ἱρὰ, πόνον δ’ ἀμέγαρτον ὄφελλεν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the nearly parallel case of Minerva (Il. vii. 311.), it is
simply stated that she refused the prayer of the Trojans,
while no notice is taken of their promised offerings.
Again, when Minerva had been offended by the Greeks,
and Agamemnon sought to appease her with hecatombs,
it is described as a proof of his folly that he could
entertain such an idea<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">οὐ γάρ τ’ αἶψα θεῶν τρέπεται νόος αἰὲν ἐόντων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>With this we may contrast the case of Neptune, who
had threatened to overwhelm the city of the Phæa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>cians
with a mountain; but who is apparently diverted
from his purpose simply by the sacrifice which, under
the advice of Alcinous, they offer to him<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

<p>Mere attributes of bulk stand at the bottom of the
scale of even human excellence; and it is so that Homer
treats them, giving them in the greatest abundance to
his Otus, his Ephialtes, and his Mars. Minerva has
them but indirectly assigned to her; and when arming
for war, Apollo never receives them at all. When his
might is described, it is always described in the loftiest
manner, that is to say, in its effects; and effort or
exertion is never attributed to either of them.</p>

<p>Even so with respect to locomotion. The highest picture
by far is that which is most negative. In general,
Apollo and Minerva move without the use of means
or instruments, such as wings, chariots, or otherwise.
While Neptune steps, and Juno’s horses spring, so
many miles at each pace, the journeys of Apollo and
Minerva are usually undescribed, undistributed. Minerva
is going from Olympus to Ithaca; when she has
departed, then she has arrived:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">βῆ δὲ κατ’ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων ἀΐξασα·</div>
       <div class="verse">στῆ δ’ Ἰθάκης ἐνὶ δήμῳ, ἐπὶ προθύροις Ὀδυσῆος<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Only within the last few years have the triumphs of
natural philosophy supplied us with an approximative
illustration of these movements over space, in the more
than lightning speed of the electric telegraph.</p>

<p>So Apollo, too, has by personal dignity what the
messenger gods have by office. It is said of him and
Iris, when in company, that their journey began; and
that it ended:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent16">τὼ δ’ ἀΐξαντε πετέσθην·</div>
       <div class="verse">Ἴδην δ’ ἵκανον πολυπίδακα<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>On one occasion, however, Minerva is represented,
even when unattended by any other deity, as employing
the foot-wings which Mercury commonly used, and
they are said to carry her<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent12">τά μιν φέρον, ἠμὲν ἐφ’ ὑγρὴν</div>
       <div class="verse">ἠδ’ ἐπ’ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν, ἅμα πνοίῃς ἀνέμοιο.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But there are no stages or intermediate points either
here or elsewhere in her journey.</p>

<p>With the movements of Apollo and Minerva, thus
conceived by the Poet, we may do well to compare those
of Mercury (Od. v. 50&ndash;8), Neptune (Il. xiii. 17&ndash;31), and
Juno (Il. xiv. 225&ndash;30).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their independent power of punishment.</i></div>

<p>6. Again, an important difference prevails between the
different divinities, in regard to the conduct they pursue
when offended by mortals. In general, this is one of
the points that prominently exhibits the sovereignty of
Jupiter; for the common course is to appeal to him,
and to obtain retribution either with his permission or
by his agency. Not from greater self-will or a spirit of
rebellion, but from higher dignity and a certain substantiveness
of character and position, Apollo and
Minerva always appear as acting for and from themselves,
in vindication of their offended prerogatives.</p>

<p>Even Neptune, when he is incensed at the erection
of the unconsecrated rampart of the Greek camp, and
fearful that it will eclipse the renown of his own handiwork,
the wall of Troy, appeals to Jupiter on the subject,
and receives from him the permissive suggestion,
that he should himself destroy it so soon as the war is
over<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. He pursues a similar course, when he is anxious
to chastise the over-boldness and maritime success of
the Phæacians<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. Venus, wounded by Diomed, does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
even by appeal attempt to obtain redress<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>. Mars, in
the same condition, makes his complaint, both of
Diomed and of Minerva, to Jupiter. It is true that
afterwards, on the death of his son, he proposes to appear
on the field of battle: but then he is in a state of
fury<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>, and is aware that the act would be one of rebellion
against Jupiter: accordingly, it is rudely stopped
by Minerva. Again, when Dionysus and his nurses are
attacked by Lycoorgus, it is Jupiter that strikes the
offender blind, and his life is short because he was
become hateful to the gods<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. Dionysus had made no
appeal; but Jupiter avenged the insult to his order.
The Sun, after his oxen have been eaten by the companions
of Ulysses, lodges his appeal with Jupiter and
the Olympian Council: and in this case Jupiter himself
undertakes to give effect to the wishes of the offended
luminary for vengeance<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. When Aides, or Pluto, repaired
to Olympus after the wound he had received
from Hercules, the presumption perhaps arises, that it
may have been not simply to obtain the healing hand
of Paieon, but also to move Jupiter for redress.</p>

<p>There are indeed a certain set of cases in which the
rule is probably different, that is to say, when a deity is
thwarted or offended in the exercise of his or her own
special function. Thus Neptune, though he would not
touch the rampart without leave, yet of his own mere
motion destroys Ajax when he is at sea. Venus threatens
Helen with her summary vengeance, in case of prolonged
resistance to the expressed command that she should
repair to the chamber of Paris. The Muses, offended
by Thamyris<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>, proceed to maim him, probably in voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
or hand, the organs connected with his profession. This
power to punish within each particular province appears
to form an exception to the general rule. It is probably
under this exceptional arrangement, that Diana
proceeds towards the Curetes, in the Legend of the
Ninth Iliad: but some doubt may hang over her case
on account of the fact, that she partakes radically of the
traditional, as well as of the mythological character.</p>

<p>Offended by the omission to include her in the
hecatombs offered to the Immortals, she sends a wild
boar to desolate the country. She puts Ariadne to
death on the application of Dionysus, without any notice
of an appeal to Jupiter. In both these cases she may
be acting in virtue of her particular powers. But when
she is matched with Juno in the Theomachy, she appears
as utterly unequal to her great antagonist.</p>

<p>When Apollo comes into view, the mode of proceeding
is very different from that of the deities of invention.
Apollo and Diana at once destroy the children
of Niobe, to avenge the insult she had offered to their
mother: and this case is the more worthy of note, because
Jupiter, at a later stage, participates in and extends
the vengeance<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. But the most conspicuous instance
of the independent retributive action of Apollo
is in the Plague of the First Book; since here he
wastes the army of the Greeks, to the great peril of the
enterprise promoted by so many powerful divinities, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
account of what he esteemed a moral offence, and an
outrage to his priest Chryses. Now it is to be remembered
that the damsel had suffered no peculiar wrongs:
the whole offence consisted in this, that, being the
daughter of a priest of Apollo, at a place apparently insignificant,
she had not been on that account exempted
from the common lot of women, but had been treated
just as she would have been treated had she been a king’s
daughter. Nor must we forget, in appreciating this act,
that the families of priests had no priestly privilege:
and that Maron paid to Ulysses (Od. ix. 201&ndash;5) a very
handsome price for his own life, together with that of
his wife and child.</p>

<p>It is less easy to bring out the application of the
rule now before us in the case of Minerva, from the
paucity of clear instances in the poems where she personally
has received offence.</p>

<p>There is one important case, where her wrath appears;
and it is there described as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μῆνις ὀλοὴ</span>, and as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεινὸς
χόλος</span><a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. Her name, and her interest in this affair, are
to some extent mixed with those of Jupiter. The Poet
tells us, that Jupiter designed for the Greeks a calamitous
Return, ‘since they were not all upright, whereupon
many of them miserably perished through the
inexorable wrath of Minerva.’ And then the order is
inverted: Agamemnon, we are told, projected the
offerings, that he might appease the anger of Minerva,
and thereupon dissension arose, for Jupiter suspended
calamity over the host. It is clear that, so far as
Minerva is to be regarded as having received separate
and personal offence in this proceeding, there is no sign
of her referring to Jupiter for aid, or for permission to
punish the offenders. But the case rather appears
to be one in which the Poet is describing the Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>vidential
Government of the world, and in which the
intermixture of the names of Jupiter and of his
daughter belongs to their system of concurrent action,
under which she shares with Apollo the office of acting
as his habitual organ in administering retributive justice
to mankind. In one clear instance, however, we find
it stated, that when the Greeks offended Minerva, she
punished them by a storm (Od. v. 108).</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>They use special attributes of Jupiter.</i></div>

<p>7. Apollo and Minerva carry this among other notes,
that we find them administering mythological or natural
powers, which are otherwise the special property of
Jupiter.</p>

<p>No other Olympian deity, but Juno, stands invested
with a similar honour. We sometimes find the aerial
powers of Jupiter wielded by her hand. But, with the
exception of the sort of precedence accorded to her on
Olympus, in virtue of which the gods rise from their
seats when she enters their company, there is no one
of the gifts that she exercises, which would not appear
to lie within the range of the offices of Minerva, if not
also of Apollo. In the remarkable case where she
thunders in honour of Agamemnon just after he has
armed, it is recorded that this was the joint act of the
two divinities, of whom, on this occasion, Minerva
takes precedence<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent6">ἐπὶ δ’ ἐγδούπησαν Ἀθηναίη τε καὶ Ἥρη,</div>
       <div class="verse">τιμῶσαι βασιλῆα πολυχρύσοιο Μυκήνης.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This association is to be observed in another passage,
where these goddesses jointly communicate courage to
a warrior. But when we find them associated in administering
the powers of atmospheric phenomena, it
is obvious that we must resort to different sources for
the means of explaining the respective agencies.
Juno, mythologically related to Jupiter as a wife, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that capacity may, without exciting surprise, take in
hand what belongs, so to speak, to the <i>ménage</i>. Minerva,
as a daughter, has no such claim; and her possession
of a standing ground which enables her to use
these powers can only be explained by a prior and more
profound affinity of traditional character, which makes
her the organ of the supreme deity.</p>

<p>But while, in the highest marks of power adhering
to Juno, Minerva seems everywhere to vie with her,
there are others, and those among the most strictly
characteristic of the head of Olympus, in which both
Minerva and Apollo share, but which are not in any
manner imparted to Juno.</p>

<p>One of the high characteristic epithets of Jupiter is
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰγίοχος</span>. And we never hear of the Ægis out of the
hands of Jupiter, except it be in those of Minerva, or of
Apollo. The Ægis is the peculiar arm of Minerva; apparently,
it <i>belongs</i> to her; and from the description of
it in the Fifth Iliad, it appears to be the counterpart, on
her side, of the chariot on the side of Juno<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>. The tunic
she puts on, however, is the tunic of Jupiter, and the
Gorgon head upon it is his sign: while the shield she
carries is not to be assailed even by his thunderbolt<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἣν οὐδὲ Διὸς δάμνησι κεραυνός.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again, the Fifteenth Book of the Iliad, Jupiter intrusts
Apollo with his own Ægis, that he may wave it on the
field of battle to intimidate the Greeks<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.</p>

<p>Partly in the relation of Minerva to Mars, whom she
punishes or controls, but more peculiarly in the use
of the magnificent symbol of the Ægis by Minerva
and Apollo, we appear to find that development of the
martial character which has been mentioned above as
included among the Jewish ascriptions to the Messiah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Proximate to, but extending beyond, the last named
distinction, there is a function mythologically confined
to Jupiter throughout the poems, with two exceptions
only. The function is that of giving indications, palpable
to men, of coming events, by the flight of birds
in many instances, but likewise by atmospheric signs.
This power is distinguished, by its connection with the
future, from a mere power over nature.</p>

<p>The exceptions are Apollo and Minerva. The former
deity is in general more largely endowed than
Minerva in regard to the future, though a less conspicuous
figure in the direction of the present. Still she
partakes, with him and with Jupiter, of this peculiar
honour.</p>

<p>On the return of Telemachus to Ithaca there appears
to him the bird called the wheeling falcon<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">κίρκος, Ἀπόλλωνος ταχὺς ἄγγελος,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>sent by Apollo as an omen of success to himself, and of
confusion to the Suitors.</p>

<p>In the final crisis of the Odyssey, which is doubtless
meant to exhibit a normal example of Providential
retribution, it seems to have been the object of the
Poet to divide the theurgic action between Minerva
and Apollo, as joint administrators of the general
government of the world. To Minerva, as the goddess
of wisdom, falls what may be called the intellectual
share<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>, the actual instruction and guidance of Ulysses,
Penelope, and Telemachus, as well as the bewildering
and hardening operations on the minds of the Suitors.
Special arrangements appear, however, to have been
introduced, so as to make a corresponding place for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Apollo. Hence it is that Theoclymenus, as the representative
of a great prophetic family, is brought into
the company of Telemachus, that he may become the
organ of Apollo in the remaining part of the drama.
This is the more remarkable, because Theoclymenus
does not repay the friendly aid he had received by
taking part in the final struggle on the side of Telemachus;
so that his share in the proceeding stands out
the more conspicuously as one altogether theurgic. In
cooperation with this arrangement, it is provided that
the crisis shall come to pass on the festival of the god,
and that the manner of trial, by the Bow, shall place
it especially under his auspices.</p>

<p>In the magnificent passage of the Twentieth Book<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>,
which describes the phantasmagoria in the palace of
Ulysses, immediately before the trial of the Bow, there
are two parts. First, the minds of the Suitors are befooled
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρέπλαγξεν δὲ νόημα</span>). Secondly, the hall is
filled with sensible portents: preternatural night envelopes
the company, the walls and beams are blood-bespattered,
phantoms glide along with downward
movement, as on their way to Erebus, the very meat
they eat is gory, their eyes are charged with involuntary
tears, their lips with unnatural smiles. Of all this
the announcement is made by Theoclymenus, a trait
which I interpret as referring the array of the phenomena
to his master Apollo. To him is thus given that
part of the operation which lies within the domain of
sense: while the purely intellectual one, that of stupefying
the Suitors, is expressly assigned to Minerva.</p>

<p>But Minerva has likewise the power over signs,
which is enjoyed by Jupiter and Apollo. As Diomed
and Ulysses are setting out on their nocturnal expedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>tion
in the Tenth Iliad, Minerva sends the apparition
of a heron to cheer them<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>: they do not see it, on
account of the darkness; but they hear the flapping of
its wings.</p>

<p>It has accordingly attracted the attention of Nägelsbach<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>,
that the power of exhibiting signs is confined
to Jupiter, Juno, Apollo, and Minerva: though he has
not proceeded to combine this with other distinctions,
at least equally remarkable, enjoyed by the two latter
divinities.</p>

<p>I have not, it will be observed, reckoned as a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέρας</span>,
or sign of the future, the case in which Juno endows
the horses of Achilles with the gift of speech: because
it appears that the prediction of their master’s death is
their own; and that she only removes the barrier to
its expression<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. She stands, therefore, in a different
position to that of Apollo and Minerva.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their dominion over Nature.</i></div>

<p>9. This command, however, over natural portents may
be viewed as part of a general dominion over nature, of
which the most varied manifestation is in Minerva.</p>

<p>It is true that, in common with most of the Olympian
deities, she does not extend her action from the
inner, or Greek, into the general range of the outer, or
Phœnician world. Nor does Apollo. But we have
clear proof that this was by a poetical arrangement,
and not from a lack of divine power: since (1) she
does act in Scheria, and assists in bringing Ulysses to
the shore of that island: (2) the class of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάντεις</span> are
found among the Cyclops: (3) Calypso is amenable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the command of the Olympian court, and speaks of
herself as belonging to the same wide class of deities
with Aurora and Ceres. (4) Minerva assigns a special
reason, namely, regard towards her uncle Neptune, for
not having accompanied Ulysses all along his voyage
(Od. xiii. 341).</p>

<p>The power of Minerva over nature seems to be universal
in kind as well as in place.</p>

<p>1. She and Apollo assume the human form in common
with other deities: but I do not find that the
gods in general become visible to one person without
being visible to all. Minerva in the First Iliad (198)
reveals herself only to Achilles. It seems as if, in
Il. xvii. 321&ndash;34, Homer meant that Apollo did the
same to Æneas. The recognition of Venus by Helen,
I take as most probably a sign of nothing more than
that the case was one of disguise, rather than of transformation<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.</p>

<p>2. Apollo frames an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴδωλον</span>, or image of a man, which
moves and fights<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>, representing Æneas on the battle
field: and Minerva frames an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴδωλον</span> of Iphthime, to
appear in a dream to her sister Penelope, and to convey
to her a revelation of Minerva’s will<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. This power
is exercised by the two divinities exclusively.</p>

<p>3. Minerva on many occasions assumes the shape of
a bird<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>: sometimes in common with Apollo<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>. Ino
Leucothee, the marine goddess, becomes a water-bird,
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὕπνος</span> takes the form of the bird Chalcis, when
he has to act upon Jupiter. Both these operations may
probably be considered as belonging to the special functions
of these agents: with Apollo and Minerva, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
power appears to belong to a general supremacy over
nature, which the other Olympian deities do not share.</p>

<p>4. The transformations and retransformations of
Ulysses in Ithaca by Minerva, appear to indicate some
organic power over matter and life. It is not the appearance
but the reality of his person that is stated to
be changed. Not only is the skin wrinkled and the
eye darkened, but the hairs are destroyed. They are
afterwards restored, and his stature is increased. In
like manner she gives increased height to Penelope, and
again to Laertes<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</p>

<p>As respects power over inanimate nature, we have
seen Minerva joined with Juno in the act of thundering.
She can order out a rattling zephyr (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κελάδοντα</span>),
or simply a toward breeze, or again a stiff Boreas
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κραιπνὸν</span>), to speed her friend across the main<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>: and, as
Juno accelerated the setting of the sun before Troy, so
Minerva forbids the dawn to appear in Ithaca, until,
when she thinks the proper time has come, she withdraws
the prohibition<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is the power of Minerva over nature for purposes
of wrath less clear than for purposes of favour:
since Mercury tells Calypso that, inasmuch as the
Greeks had offended her, she sent a storm upon them<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent24">Ἀθηναίην ἀλίτοντο,</div>
       <div class="verse">ἥ σφιν ἐπῶρσ’ ἄνεμόν τε κακὸν καὶ κύματα μακρά.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the other hand, when Ulysses and his companions
have propitiated Apollo on behalf of the Greek army,
then he sends them a toward breeze for their return
to the camp<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. But we have a still more notable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>stance
of miraculous power over nature ascribed to
Apollo, over and above the sublime portents of the
Twentieth Odyssey, in the conversion of the mouths of
the eight Idæan rivers for nine whole days to efface
the Greek rampart<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. To Neptune is left the task of
restoring them to their channels: perhaps on the
same principle as the treatment of Juno, relatively to
Minerva, in the preparation and use of the chariot<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>.</p>

<p>We have not yet, however, done with the subject of
powers exercised over nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Relation of Apollo together with Diana to Death.</i></div>

<p>The most prominent and pointed characteristic of
Apollo is one shared with his sister Diana. It is the
mysterious relation which these two deities hold in
common to death.</p>

<p>The Messianic tradition, first divided between Apollo
and the great Minerva, is now subdivided between him
and his sister Diana, who forms a kind of supplement to
his divinity. The bow and arrows, the symbol which
they bear in common, marks the original union in character,
out of which their twin peculiarities had grown.</p>

<p>Apollo, indeed, as we see in the first Book of the
Iliad, could himself become, like his sister, the immediate
agent in the destruction of animals: but his principal
function is with men. Hence the terrible
slaughter of the Plague: hence his extraordinary and
otherwise unsatisfactory participation in the death of
Patroclus: hence, above all, though he is not the
patron of Ulysses, and has no special connection with
him, yet the slaughter of the Suitors in the Odyssey is
appointed to take place on his festival, and therefore,
as well as because it is effected by the Bow, under his
auspices. But again; his office is not of a single
aspect: he is a saviour from death, as well as a destroyer.
Hence it is he, and not Venus, who saves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Æneas<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>: it is he who carries Hector out of danger<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>.
Yet a third, and very peculiar form of his office do we
discover, common to him and to his sister. She is
upon occasion strong enough to exercise the office of
destruction properly so called<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>, for sometimes she slays
in wrath. But more usually, as he does for men, so she
more especially exercises for women the mysterious
function of administering painless and gentle death.</p>

<p>This singular and solemn relation of Apollo and
Diana to death appears to have an entirely exclusive
character attaching to it. There is a clear distinction
between death inflicted by the symbolical arrows of
these twin deities, which are the symbols of an invisible
Power, and death resulting from physical or any other
palpable causes, whether it be violent, or what we term
natural. I do not now speak of the agency of Apollo
the destroyer in (what we call) the Plague, nor of his
slaying Eurytus on account of a personal insult (Od. viii.
227), but of the much more distinctive and prominent
office assigned to him and to Diana, that of (so to speak)
taking the sting from Death. Death by disease, Death by
a broken heart<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>, Death by shipwreck, or by the lightning
of heaven<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>, or by the fury of Scamander, whirling
warriors to the sea, and burying them in the sand and
shingle<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>, are matters altogether distinct from this. Death
through second causes, even man can bring about: Death
without second causes is palpably Divine; and this it is
that is assigned to Apollo and Diana only among the
Homeric gods. There is no instance, if I remember
rightly, in which any other among them brings about the
death of a mortal, otherwise than by means of second
causes. And there is one curious passage, from which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
would appear that some other deities had to apply to
them in order to set in motion this Divine prerogative.
For when Theseus was carrying Ariadne to Athens, she
did not reach her journey’s end:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent18">πάρος δέ μιν Ἄρτεμις ἔκτα</div>
       <div class="verse">Δίῃ ἐν ἀμφιρύτῃ, Διονύσου μαρτυρίῃσιν<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A period was put to her life in the island of Dia, by the
goddess Artemis, at the instance of Dionysus. As if
the tradition bore, that Dionysus or Bacchus, desiring
her death, and having at his command no natural
agency of mortal effect, was obliged to apply to Artemis
or Diana to bring about this purpose.</p>

<p>The great enemy and scourge of mankind, under the
treatment of the twin deities, is stripped of his terrors;
and the very verse of Homer, ever responsive to his
thought, changes to an easy and flowing movement as he
describes this mode of passage from the world<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent14">τὴν δ’ Ἄρτεμις ἰοχέαιρα</div>
       <div class="verse">οἷς ἀγανοῖς βελέεσσιν ἐποιχομένη κατέπεφνεν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nor is the expression casual; it is one of the regular
Homeric <i>formulæ</i>. Sometimes she discharges this office
in actual concurrence with Apollo. The happy island,
where Eumæus passed his childhood, knew neither
famine nor disease: but when its people reached the
term of their old age, then<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἐλθὼν ἀργυρότοξος Ἀπόλλων Ἀρτέμιδι ξὺν</div>
       <div class="verse">οἷς ἀγανοῖς βελέεσσιν ἐποιχόμενος κατέπεφνεν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again, when the corpse of Hector is by preternatural
agency restored, after the lacerations it had
undergone, to integrity and freshness, it is said to have
become like to the body of him upon whom Apollo
has come, and put him to death with his tender darts<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
The god has a sword, indeed, which must appertain to his
destroying office. But his sword, and his only, among
all we hear of, is formed of gold, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρυσάορος</span>. The epithet
has probably been chosen from its affinity to Light.</p>

<p>Among the instances in which Diana ministers to
death, there are many where she clearly exercises a
mitigating and favouring agency; and this may probably
be signified in nearly all. Even of the children
of Niobe<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> it may be meant, that they were thus gently
removed, the innocent causes of their mother’s pride;
while she was reserved for heavier punishment, and
doomed to weep eternally in stone.</p>

<p>In considering what may have been the early traditional
source of these remarkable attributes of the
children of Latona, we should tread softly and carefully,
for we are on very sacred ground. But we seem
to see in them the traces of the form of One, who,
as an all-conquering King, was to be terrible and destructive
to His enemies, but who was also, on behalf
of mankind, to take away the sting from Death, and to
change its iron band for a thread of silken slumber.</p>

<p>The share of Messianic tradition accorded in this
particular province to Minerva appears, as has already
been observed, to consist in her peculiar power within
the realm of Aidoneus himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Independence of second causes.</i></div>

<p>10. Lastly, we appear to find, that in the conduct of
those operations in which their power over Nature is
exhibited, Minerva and Apollo are not tied down, or
at least are not tied down in the same degree with the
other deities generally, to the use of instruments or
symbols.</p>

<p>We find that Neptune, when he has to inspire courage
into the two Ajaxes, strikes them, (Il. xiii. 59.) As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
an accompanying significant act, of a nature tending by
itself to produce the result, this greatly weakens the
force of the passage in proof of divine or extraordinary
power. In like manner, when the same divinity converts
the ship of the Phæacians into a rock, he drives it
downward with his hand<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>.</p>

<p>But Apollo performs no such outward act when he
infuses courage into Hector, or into Glaucus; or when
he heals the wounds of the latter chieftain<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</p>

<p>So likewise, when Minerva alters the personal appearance
of Telemachus, Ulysses, Laertes, or Penelope,
by improving it, she uses no sign or ministrative act.
Only when she effects an organic though partial transformation
in the case of Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> does she strike him
with her wand: but then this total transformation is an
exercise of power, of which we have no other example
among the Olympian deities. Again, when Minerva
finally endows the hero with heightened beauty of figure
and countenance, it is done without the use of any
visible sign whatever<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>.</p>

<p>This employment of instruments is, in fact, susceptible
of two significations. They may be, like the
tokens of Jupiter, intended to act upon the senses of
men. But where they have not this meaning, there is
a decided tendency to convey the conception of the
instrument as being itself the power which the deity
merely directs and applies. Thus it is in the cestus of
Venus and the wand of Mercury that the divine energy
resides<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>, not less than it is in the herbs of Paieon and
in the fire of Vulcan. So that any exemption from the
use of these symbols is a sign of belonging to a high
order of deity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Superiority of their moral standard.</div>

<p>We now approach the third and last division of this
subject; namely, those points of distinction which
most essentially belong to the moral tone and personal
character of these two great divinities.</p>

<p>Their moral standard is conspicuously raised above
that of the Olympian family in general.</p>

<p>It partakes indeed, as we might expect, of taint.
Each has begun to give way; and each in the way
adapted to their several relations with man and
woman’s nature respectively. Apollo’s character has
just begun to be touched by licentiousness: and the
character of Minerva is not above condescension to
deceit.</p>

<p>She is nowhere, however, associated either directly
or indirectly, in word or act, with anything impure.
The contest of beauty, in which Paris was the judge, is
mentioned by Homer<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>: but the notice, a very succinct
one, though not quite in keeping with her highest dignity,
does not imply any deviation from her elevated
chastity. Neither of Juno, nor of Thetis, can the
same virtue be fully predicated: both of them, though
in different modes, are brought into immediate contact
with the subject of sensual passion.</p>

<p>Pallas is, in truth, no less chaste than Diana: but her
purity is absorbed in the dazzling splendour of her
august prerogatives, while it is more observed in the
Huntress-maid, because it is the most salient and distinguished
point in her character.</p>

<p>In the post-Homeric, but yet early, hymn to Venus,
three beings alone in the wide universe are declared to
be exempt from her sway. One of them is Hestie,
who represents the impersonation of the marriage
bond and the family life, and whose exemption therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
testifies directly to the nature of the dominion from
which it frees her. The other two privileged beings are
Pallas and Diana<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>.</p>

<p>The character of Apollo in this respect is by some
degrees less elevated: for he is an enjoying spectator
of the scene described by the certainly licentious lay of
Demodocus in the Eighth Odyssey, from which the goddesses
in a body absent themselves. In the legend, too,
of the Ninth Iliad we find that Apollo carried off the
daughter of Marpessa, afterwards named by her parents
Alcyone: but this passage, we shall see, is susceptible
of an interpretation, which gives it another construction,
and one certainly far more agreeable to the general
character of this divinity. The epithet enjoyed by the
Homeric Diana, expressive of purity, is accorded by
Æschylus<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> (whose accuracy and truthfulness often recall

</div></div></div>

<p>And here the question arises, how did it happen that,
while the element of purity was strictly preserved in
the tradition of the Wisdom, it was lost in the twin
tradition of the Seed of the woman?</p>

<p>The Wisdom naturally, when impersonated, assumed
the feminine form. Now the character of woman
seems to be in itself better fenced against impurity
than that of man. Her comparatively dependent condition,
and the more direct operation of her failure in
this respect on the marriage tie through the disorganization
of the family, have had a further influence in giving
an additional stringency to the ideas of mankind with
respect to her observance of this virtue; a stringency
not the less real, because it exemplifies the partial
administration of a law essentially just, nor because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
has become rather less conspicuous since the Gospel laid
down with rigour, upon higher grounds, one law for all.
Thus it remained possible to conceive a woman chaste,
after the conditions of that idea had been almost lost
in connection with the standard of excellence in the
other sex: and this virtue, banished from the earth in
general, still found here and there, even down to the
fœtid corruption of the time of Martial<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>, a last refuge in
individual cases of untainted womanhood. This course
of thought and feeling is exemplified in the Minerva of
the Olympian Court.</p>

<p>Yet the idea was not simply extinguished in the
twin tradition, of which Apollo is the chief representative.
Submerged in him, a home is found for it in
the appropriate form of Diana as his sister. The
power and majesty of this form of the Messianic tradition
fall chiefly to his share: she retains what was
then, to the shame of our race, thought its less precious
ingredient, freedom from sensual taint. Apollo
would have been its natural vehicle: but in him, for
the reason that he was a man, it was perhaps to the
Greek mind inconceivable: a new vehicle was either
framed, or adapted, in order to carry it: the idea of the
great Deliverer that should be born was thus disintegrated,
like other traditions, and like other historical
characters, which men could not so readily embrace in
their integrity.</p>

<p>As this is the first point in the discussion at which
we have encountered an actual instance of this disintegration,
it may be well to explain the meaning I attach
to the term.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Disintegration of traditions.</i></div>

<p>It seems indubitable, that moral combinations, which
are intelligible as well as credible to one age, may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>come
incredible to another. Just as there are individual
men at every epoch, who cannot believe in generosity
and elevation of character, because they have
in themselves no mirror which can reflect such qualities;
so a generation ruled by more debased ideas cannot
comprehend what another, influenced by less impure
tendencies, could readily embrace. On the same principle,
the Gospel gives not to the sagacious, but to the
‘pure in heart,’ the greatest triumph of mental vision,
namely, that ‘they shall see God<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>.’</p>

<p>Accordingly, when it happens that a tradition becomes
unintelligible to the mind of a given people, it
is lost. It may be lost by the disappearance even of its
outward form and shell. Or it may be lost by the
alteration of its meaning while its words are retained.
Or the work of destruction may take another turn: it
may be lost by being torn into pieces; the effect being
that one old tradition disappears, and more than one
partial substitute for it is created.</p>

<p>The highest fraud and the highest force appear to
have been, according to original tradition, joined in the
Evil One: they were separated in the Grecian forms
of<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> that tradition. The Apollo of Homer was still one,
with a great diversity of gifts; but mythological solecisms
were already apparent in his character, like cracks
in a stately building. This, too, was settled by disintegration;
and in the later mythology there were many
Apollos: other causes probably concurring to extend
the multiplying process.</p>

<p>The same operation took effect upon the traditions
of human character. Homer, with the finest powers
of light and shade, has represented Helen as erring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and as penitent. The moral sense of later, less simple,
and more deeply corrupted, times became impervious
to a balanced conception of this kind. Accordingly,
the one Helen was torn into two, and supplied material
both for the guilty Helen, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴδωλον</span> of Helen, at Troy,
and for the innocent Helen detained in Egypt. In
like manner, it became a question, probably first when
Athens had grown great, how Minos could on the one
hand be great and wise, and could on the other have
made war and imposed tribute upon Attica. Hence
the fable of two Minoses<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>: so that those who venerated
the ancient traditions of Crete might still be allowed
to cherish their pious sentiment, while, upon the other
hand, the Athenian dramatists might exercise a fertile
imagination in inventing circumstances of horror for
the biography of the piratical enemy of their country.</p>

<p>It was, I conceive, an early example of this disintegration,
which divided between Apollo and Diana different
members of a primitive Messianic tradition. And,
when we again combine the two personalities of the
brother and the sister in one, the tradition resumes its
completeness and roundness.</p>

<p>It is likely that the same mental process, which thus
deposited the element of chastity in the person of the
comparatively feeble Diana, also conferred on her the
figure of the Huntress-Queen. For thus she lived
in seclusion from the ways and haunts of man: and it
was only by seclusion that she could be kept in maiden
innocence.</p>

<p>But although the logical turn of the Greek mind soon
came to place Apollo in morally disadvantageous contrast,
under this particular head, both with his sister and
with Pallas, he may be favourably compared with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
other Homeric gods. There is something in the tradition
that he was unshorn (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκερσεκόμης</span>), which is evidently
intended to connect him with the innocence of
youth. And in Homer, unless it be by the legend of
the Ninth Iliad, he is unharmed by connection with
any of those relations which assign to Jupiter, Neptune,
Mars, and Mercury, human children as the fruit of
their indulgence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Legend of Marpessa.</i></div>

<p>The reasons which lead me to suppose that the legend
of Marpessa is not of a sensual character are
these. The words used are<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὅτε μιν ἑκάεργος ἀνήρπασε Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now none of the numerous intrigues of the mythical
deities with women include violence: they always appear,
so far as the language used gives them a specific character,
to have been voluntarily accepted connections<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.
It was not likely that the case of Apollo should have
been the exception. Again, they are always mentioned
as having led to the birth of children: but there is no
such mention in this case, and Apollo has no human
progeny. Lastly, the word used does not mean <i>ravished</i>,
but <i>seized and carried up</i>. It nearly corresponds with
the expression in the case of Ganymede<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">τὸν καὶ ἀνηρείψαντο θεοὶ Διὶ οἰνοχοεύειν,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and it may have been either a case of translation, or
one in which the maid was conceived to have been
taken for the service of the deity, perhaps at the
neighbouring shrine of Delphi.</p>

<p>After the part which the lay of Demodocus assigns
to him, the most, perhaps the only, discreditable transaction
assigned to Apollo in the poems is the manner
in which he disarms and partially disables Patroclus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Nothing can be more wretched than his operations on
this occasion. The god comes up to the hero enveloped
in cloud; strikes him from behind on the back; and
knocks off his armour. I can conceive but one explanation
for this singular passage, which appears alike
unsatisfactory from a poetical and from a mythological
point of view. That explanation I think is to be sought
in intense nationality. The main purpose of the poem
required the sacrifice of a principal Greek hero: but
no genuine Greek hero could be killed by fair means,
therefore it was necessary to dispose of him by such as
were foul. It is perhaps also worth remark that the
audacity of Patroclus in pushing on to the city may perhaps
have rendered him punishable (Il. xvi. 698&ndash;711).</p>

<p>It is remarkable, however, that the character of
each of the two great traditive deities had begun to
give way to corruption, and each in the point at which,
according to the respective sex, its yielding might have
been anticipated. As unchastity is more readily pardoned,
according to social usage, in the man, so is
deceit in the woman. And in this point the standard
had already fallen for Minerva.</p>

<p>Of this we have one most clear indication, in her being
commissioned to undertake the charge of inciting Pandarus
to a very black act of treachery, the breach of
the Pact. So far from being unwilling in this matter,
she was even eager<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὣς εἰπὼν ὤτρυνε πάρος μεμαυῖαν Ἀθήνην.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Besides judgment and industrial skill, she gave <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κέρδεα</span>
to Penelope<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>: and she describes herself<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> as excelling
among the gods in craft as well as counsel;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">μήτι τε κλέομαι καὶ κέρδεσιν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>With the exception of this initial tendency to de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>generate
on the side of craft, we may say with truth
that the highest moral tone, both of speech and action,
is reserved for Minerva in particular throughout the
poems, whether in the Olympian Court, or in her intercourse
with men. Alike in the Iliad and the
Odyssey, her counsel, which prevails, undoubtedly
also deserves to prevail. She is in both the champion
of the righteous cause. And when she states for the
second time the case of Ulysses before the assembled
gods, it is not now as before his liberality in sacrifice
that she pleads, but, as a last resort, she makes bold to
urge the bad moral effect which will result, if they discourage
virtue by permitting the ruin of this excellent
man<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their place in Providential Government.</i></div>

<p>2. It is in conformity with the expectations, which
the superior morality of Apollo and Minerva tends to
raise, that we find them occupying a position such as is
accorded to no other deity in the Providential government
both of the human mind and will, and likewise
of the course of events external to it.</p>

<p>The origin of this position may, as I conceive, be
found in the traditions which they inherit, and according
to which they would naturally be exhibited as the
administrators of the government of the world, on
behalf, if I may so speak, of the Godhead.</p>

<p>But there were, among the inborn tendencies of
polytheism, two at least which powerfully tended to
give to these divinities a position not only associated
with that of Jupiter, but on the one hand more palpable
and practical, and on the other of higher moral
elevation. These were the tendencies which, among
the incidents of his supremacy, on the one hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
blessed him with personal repose, and, on the other,
endowed him with unbounded appetite. The first, by
making Apollo and Minerva, as his organs, the practical
governors of the world, tended to increase their
importance at the expense of his, and the second gave
them a moral title as it were to gain ground upon
him. In the time of Homer this process was considerably
advanced; so that while they seem to share
with Jupiter the office of general direction, which they
hold subject to his control, it falls to one of them, to
Minerva especially, to conduct the highest of all the
divine processes in the administration of moral discipline,
and in the exercise of influence over the human
soul.</p>

<p>In the war before Troy, what is done by Juno or
by Neptune is commonly done in the way of unauthorized,
or even of forbidden, interference. In this,
Minerva shares: for she has a less perfect conformity
of will with that of Jupiter than Apollo, though she
has a more profound moral resemblance of character
to the ideal, from which the Homeric Jupiter was a
depravation. Of the action before Troy, however, as a
whole, thus much remains true: that, when the will
of Jupiter is to be wrought out in favour of the Greeks,
it is done entirely by Minerva, and when in favour of
the Trojans it is done entirely by Apollo. Each therefore
appears as the proper minister of Jupiter, when
willing, for conducting the government of mankind.
One of them is always willing: and though the other
is not equally acquiescent, still it is the view of the
case taken by her, in common with other gods more
weighty than numerous, to which Jupiter ultimately
gives way. Thus we may discern, graven as it were
upon the relation between themselves and Jupiter, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
mark which shows that it was originally derived from
the office of Him, ‘by whom God made the worlds<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.’
Scarcely ever do we find Homer deviate from the general
rule which exhibits them as the ordinary Providence
of the world for governing the detail of life. There is,
I think, but one part of the Iliad which exhibits to us
any considerable assumption of this function by Jupiter
himself. It is during the latter part of the day which
was to be closed by a sunset fatal to Hector, that,
besides sending forth Apollo with the blinding Ægis,
he himself descends to such acts of minute interference
as breaking the bowstring of Teucer<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>It is frequently ascribed to them.</i></div>

<p>Regarded from without, these two deities appear to
us as frequently receiving from men the ascriptions
of Divine Providence.</p>

<p>The idea of Divine Providence is frequently expressed
by Homer under the names <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεὸς, θεοὶ, ἀθάνατοι,
δαίμων</span>. It is also often conveyed by the name Jupiter
alone, or by such an expression as ‘Jupiter and the
other immortal gods,’ in which he appears at their
head. In one place of the Odyssey, though only one,
the day being the festival of Apollo, this very extraordinary
distinction is assigned to him: and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τις</span> of
the Suitors thus places him at the head of the Olympian
company<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent24">εἴ κεν Ἀπόλλων</div>
       <div class="verse">ἡμῖν ἱλήκῃσι καὶ ἀθάνατοι θεοὶ ἄλλοι.</div>
</div></div></div>


<p>Sometimes mortal men look to one of these deities
for success in their enterprises, even without naming
Jupiter: sometimes that name is conjoined with one
of theirs. Apollo himself, appearing to Hector in the
form of Asius his uncle, exhorts that chieftain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
attack Patroclus, ‘in the hope that Apollo may give
him success<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.’ Presently, Patroclus, dying, attributes
Hector’s victory to Jupiter and Apollo, his own death
to Apollo and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μοῖρα</span><a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>; Apollo, says Xanthus the immortal
horse, slew Patroclus, and gave glory to Hector<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>.
This cannot well apply to the direct agency of the
god in the matter, as he only disarmed the Greek
hero. Again, when Patroclus is slain, Minerva takes
no part in the proceedings. When Hector is about to
be vanquished Apollo retires, and Minerva straightway
appears upon the field<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. In the Doloneia, Ulysses
and Diomed succeed, because Jupiter and Minerva
befriend them<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>. Minerva rejoices, when she finds her
name invoked first of all the gods<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>: and she instructs
Laertes to call upon Jupiter with herself, assuming for
her own name the first place;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">εὐξάμενος κούρῃ Γλαυκώπιδι καὶ Διὶ πατρί<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Agamemnon feels that he is certain to take Troy, if
only Jupiter and Minerva will it<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>. Ulysses expects to
slay the Suitors ‘by the favour of Jupiter and Minerva<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>.’
But in fact, the whole scheme of divine retribution, of
which that hero is the organ, was planned by Minerva
and not by Jupiter, as is twice declared to us from his
own lips<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>. I must not, however, omit to notice one passage
of peculiar grandeur, in which Jupiter and Minerva
are combined, as joint arbiters of great events. In
the Sixteenth Odyssey, Telemachus exhorts his father,
amid their gloomy and doubtful prospects, to bethink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
him of obtaining some ally. He nobly replies as follows:
‘I will tell you, and do you answer me and say,
whether Athene with Zeus her father will not suffice
for us, or whether I shall study to find some other
defender.’ The rejoinder of Telemachus is in the
same exalted strain. ‘Yes, these are good, though they
be afar off, sitting on high; for they prevail over all
others, whether they be men, or whether they be immortal
gods<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Especially in the highest sense to Minerva.</i></div>

<p>It should be observed, that they are not the lower and
more external forms of providential action which devolve
on Minerva, with a reservation of the higher
parts to Jupiter. On the contrary, in what we may
call external and wholesale Providence, Jupiter is supreme;
and in the conflict between Ulysses and the
Ithacan rebels, as well as in various passages of the
Iliad relating to external action, Jupiter interposes to
check her eager spirit. In the last Odyssey she asks
his designs. He recommends a pacification. She thereupon
exhorts and assists old Laertes to begin the
battle. At length a thunderbolt descends from Jupiter,
and it falls at Minerva’s feet. She then interposes
to make peace<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus it is in battle and matters of the strong hand:
but the higher and deeper forms of providential action
appear to be unheeded by Jupiter, and to fall to the lot
of these two deities, more particularly of Minerva.</p>

<p>In the Odyssey, one of the Suitors, Amphinomus,
better minded than the rest, anticipates evil at an
early juncture, and is disposed to take the advice given
him by Ulysses, that he should quit the palace, and
return home. But he did not even now, says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Poet, escape doom: for Minerva fettered him, that he
should fall beneath the hand of Telemachus<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. And
further, she works inwardly on the minds of the
Suitors, ‘not suffering them,’ such is the remarkable
phrase, ‘to abstain from their biting insolence:’ so that
pain might yet more deeply pierce the soul of Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">μνηστῆρας δ’ οὐ πάμπαν ἀγήνορας εἴα Ἀθήνη</div>
       <div class="verse">λώβης ἴσχεσθαι θυμαλγέος, ὄφρ’ ἔτι μᾶλλον</div>
       <div class="verse">δύη ἄχος κραδίην Λαερτιάδην Ὀδυσῆα.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This passage is subsequently repeated; and it stands
as one of those remarkable Homeric formulæ, which
are used with such extraordinary grandeur of effect in
the later books of the Odyssey; returning upon the
ear like the solemn tolling of a funeral bell.</p>

<p>But the sentiments which the passage contains are
in themselves most remarkable, and perhaps only find a
parallel in the awful language of Holy Writ; ‘and the
Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he should not let
the people go<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>.’ They describe at once the doctrine of
Providence, and the essential laws of human nature, in
their loftiest and severest form. They show us the hardening
power of a long continued course of offences against
the moral law, which at length converts the most unbounded
license into the most absolute slavery, under
the iron yoke of habitual depravity; and they likewise
exhibit the figure of Deity superintending this terrible,
but natural as well as judicial retribution, which is the
ultimate and effective sanction of the whole moral
code, alike in the earlier and in the later stages of the
Divine dispensations. Besides all this, the passage
exhibits to us pain administered to the just man, in
order to prove his resolution, and steel him, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
may be the fitting minister of divine vengeance. Nor
does this process of probation cease here: for the conflict
with the Suitors is a prolonged one; and it is prolonged,
because Minerva was still making trial of the
constancy of Ulysses and his son<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>, as of metal in the
fire.</p>

<p>It is hard to find even approximations to such a picture
in the later heathen literature, particularly after
Æschylus: and in Homer no function of this kind is
ever attributed to an ordinary deity; nor even to Jupiter,
whose place in the government of mankind, if estimated
morally, is lower than that of Minerva. I shall
have occasion shortly to glance further at this subject.</p>

<p>The higher powers attaching to the character of the
great Deliverer of man, besides being more or less obscured
in each case, are by the disintegration, with
which we may now have become familiar, divided between
Apollo and Minerva; so that while in some, and
indeed in most, points of view, it is a common character
which distinguishes and severs them from the deities of
mere invention, in others we must combine the gifts of
one with those of the other, in order to get at the
entire outline of the ancient tradition.</p>

<p>Thus we have seen, that Minerva exercises higher
functions in Providential government, and in the administration
of the general laws of our nature, than are
wielded even by the Homeric Jupiter. We have also
partially considered why it is, that she thus attains a superiority
which, undoubtedly, no pristine tradition could
while unaltered accord to her. At present I proceed to
observe, that we may find a counterpart to this paramount
prerogative of Minerva in the gift of fore and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
after knowledge, possessed most peculiarly and largely
by Apollo.</p>

<p>Calchas, Seer of the Greek army, knew what was,
what had been, and what was to be, by the gift which
Phœbus Apollo had conferred on him<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>. It is the business
of this order, who are ministers of Apollo, to interpret
all signs and presages to men in virtue of the
prerogative of that deity. In the Fifteenth Book, indeed,
Apollo inquires of Hector the cause of his evil
plight: but he has not yet put off his <i>incognito</i>, as we
see from the reply of Hector;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">τίς δὲ σύ ἐσσι, φέριστε θεῶν<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">;</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And, while Jupiter has the single and remote oak of
Dodona for the delivery of oracles to men, Apollo has
already his Pythian temple in the very heart of Greece,
and hard by the great highway across the Corinthian
gulf, and has likewise a shrine at Delos for that purpose;
for we must presume that, when Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> stopped
to visit Delos on his way home, it was in order to obtain
information as to his fate. Thus Apollo appears
to stand first of the gods in regard to knowledge of
events, as Minerva does with respect to the ordinary
government of mankind. Nor does Homer scruple to
call this favourite divinity the first of the gods; an expression,
however, which he employs with latitude, and
which must not be too rigidly construed<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">θεῶν ὤριστος, ὃν ἠΰκομος τέκε Λητώ.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I have already observed that the abstract words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</span>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ</span>, which are generally used by Homer to convey
the idea of Providence, are when so used commonly
referable in the main to Jupiter, so far as we can con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>nect
them at all with any of the Olympian personages.
Sometimes, however, they are determined by the sense
of the passage to signify Minerva or Apollo; but I
think they never, when they relate to Providential
action, mean any other divinity.</p>

<p>It is by no means from any merely national, or even
personal predilection, but it is mainly from the lofty
standing ground of a Providence, that Minerva follows
Ulysses: it is in the same general character that Apollo
is made a party in the final crisis of the Odyssey
through the introduction of his festival, and of the
Bow.</p>

<p>In the Olympian assemblage, it is Minerva who
really represents the element of mind and its inborn
supremacy over all other forces. She proceeds upon
principles, when Juno acts upon partial attachments;
and her superiority is so great, as to be wholly inexplicable
under the hypothesis which would represent the
characters and attributes of all alike as the mere products
of invention.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Intimacy of Minerva’s personal relations.</i></div>

<p>The offices of both these deities, but especially of Minerva,
in relation to the guidance of human conduct, are
much higher than those of any other deity in their kind.
Not only do they both act in the largest and most free
manner on the human mind by inward influence, but, if
there is any trace in the Homeric system of what may
be called spiritual religion, of the tender and intimate
relations which have from the first subsisted between
the children of faith and their Father in Heaven, it is
in Minerva that we must seek for it. It is indeed but
a faint resemblance that we shall find; the very application
of the word may be disputable. Yet it is
something, which appears to show that it was at any
rate not of heathen origin: that it is a flower, sickly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
because transplanted from a better to a less kindly
soil; a shadow, or a wreck of something greater and
better, and not a scheme built up from beneath. The
mode in which Minerva cares for Ulysses deserves at
least thus much of honour. It is a contact so close
and intimate, a care so sleepless and so tender, embracing
alike the course of events without, and the state of
mind within; so affectionate in relation to the person,
yet so entirely without the least partiality or caprice;
so personal, yet so far from what Holy Scripture calls,
with the highest perfection of phrase, respect of persons;
so deeply founded on general laws of truth and justice,
even if some deviations can be detected, by a jealous
eye, in the choice of subsidiary means; that, as it is
without any thing like a parallel in the ruder and
meaner relations of men with the deities of invention,
so it makes its own audible and legitimate claim to a
higher origin. The principle at least of inward and
sustained intercourse between the Deity and the soul of
man is perceptibly represented to us by the literature
of Greece in a case like this, and, with the very partial
and qualified exception of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δαίμων</span> of Socrates, in
such a case only.</p>

<p>Minerva, again, can affect the mind with a friendly
bewilderment; as when she paralyses for a moment the
understanding of the nurse Euryclea, that she may not
give an answer, which would be inconvenient, to the
question of Penelope<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>. To her Ulysses looks for the
right rearing of his son: and she assures him he need have
no anxiety<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>. Even as respects the human person, no
powers so large are any where ascribed by Homer to
any other deity as those which she exercises, especially
in the transformation and re-transformation of Ulysses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>Form of their relation to their attributes.</i></div>

<p>3. Another very remarkable distinction, or rather cluster
of distinctions, attaching to these deities, relates to
the manner in which they bear their attributes. Speaking
generally, the deities of pure invention are the mere
impersonations of a passion, or of an elemental or bodily
power, or of a mental gift. They are, in the order of
ideas, posterior and ministerial to their own attributes:
the mere vehicles for carrying them into movement
and action, so that in truth the persons are the embellishments
and the attributes of qualities, and not the
qualities attributes of persons. To state it at the very
highest, the inventive divinity is the steward of his own
gifts.</p>

<p>Now the traditive god is their proprietor and master.
In the case of the two great traditive deities, Apollo
and Minerva, the relation between function and person
exactly reverses that which has been described. Here
the attribute is something attached to, something in
the possession and under the command of, the person;
as much so, as the unerring bow of Apollo, or the
invincible spear of Minerva. It is not Apollo, but it is
the bow of Apollo, which stands in the relation to his
office as minister of death, that Vulcan himself bears
to the element of fire and to the metallic art, or Mars
to the passions and the strong hand of war. If we
except the single case of the choice garment of Juno<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>,
Minerva neither spins nor hammers. Mars always
appears fighting, but Apollo does not always appear prophesying
or playing the lyre, a function which he seems
to perform only in the company of the gods.</p>

<p>The difference is strongly marked in Homer, by the
fact that the invented divinities of the second order are
identified in common language with their offices. Ares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
is a synonym for a spear: fire is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φλὸξ Ἡφαίστοιο</span>, or
even simply <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἥφαιστος</span><a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>: the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span> is absolutely
identified with a great natural object: corn is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δημήτερος
ἀκτή</span>. But no analogous phrase is applicable to Apollo or
to Minerva in Homer. As, with the lapse of time, the
will and fancy of man did its work more fully upon the
idea of deity, the names of other divinities fell within
the circle; and the remembrance of tradition having
become fainter and fainter, in the time of Horace the
word Minerva could be used for wit (Hor. Sat. II. ii. 3);</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rusticus, abnormis sapiens, crassâque Minervâ.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But, as is often the case, in this change, external as
it is, and apparently slight, we have an outward sign of
the profound alterative process, which in Homer’s time
had largely begun, and which continued until the incrustation
and absorption of religious truth became
entire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their capacity to attract new ones.</i></div>

<p>4. In conformity with the last-named indication is
another, which I have next to notice. The traditive
god is capable of receiving new functions; apparently
because he is not the servant of the old ones: but the
deity who is a mere personal expression for a certain idea,
can, as a general rule, have no duty or prerogative
beyond its bounds, more than can a counter beyond the
thing which it has been chosen to signify. Hence Vulcan,
Venus, Mars, Ceres, Bacchus, even Mercury, the god of
gain, continue, after as well as in Homer, to be devoted
to and identified with their several functions. Only in
the case of Mercury, as traffic involves motion from
place to place, and the acts of both honest and dishonest
persuasion, he is in Homer, and he afterwards
continues to be more generally, a messenger and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>ductor,
a negotiator and a rhetorician, as well as a
thief. But even Juno, elevated as she is in station,
yet, having been called into Olympus as a vehicle for
conveying the idea of maternity, continues to be charged
with that office, and is not specifically invested with
any other. Such attributions as are implied in the
Venus Victrix, or other like dedications, are indeed at
variance with these propositions; but they belong to
a later and greatly altered state of the old mythology,
when it had reached to an immeasurable distance from
its source, and had lost the traces even of its own
early features. But in the cases of Apollo and Minerva,
we perceive that the traditive deity was not
thus ‘cabined, cribbed, confined.’</p>

<p>We find the Apollo of Homer the deity of the following
particular functions:</p>

<p>1. The lyre and poetry, Il. i. 603.</p>

<p>2. Divination, Il. i. 72.</p>

<p>3. Healing, Il. xvi. 517.</p>

<p>4. The bow, Il. i. 49. ii. 827.</p>

<p>5. Death, either gentle and painless, or not referable
to any known cause, such as ordinary disease or
wounds.</p>

<p>Besides all this, he may be called, with Pallas, the
god of Help in general; and, even within the range of
single attributes, he shews an immense diversity. He
was the god at once of the severe and simple music
of the Dorians<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>, and of the rabid ecstasy of the Pythoness.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible that he could have begun his
career in the Greek mythology with such an assemblage
of functions, not only not united by any obvious tie,
but some of them in apparent contradiction with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
another. Probably the constitutive ideas of the tradition
he represented were fitted out by a gradual process
with this outward apparatus of prerogatives; each
of which, when taken singly, was in harmony with them.
Nor was the operation completed even in the time of
Homer, as we see from the curious case of the Sun.</p>

<p>We may, I apprehend, view that case in either of
two aspects. We may consider what was historically the
progress of the traditions concerning the Sun from their
source to their maturity, when they were incorporated
into the comprehensive deity of Apollo: or we may
examine the moral affinities, which determined the
direction and conclusion of their career.</p>

<p>Historically, I presume that the Homeric tradition
of the Sun represents a separate and recent importation
from a foreign country, which had not as yet been
fitted into a place of its own in the Greek mythology.
It therefore wanders as it were unappropriated, and
hangs in temporary suspense.</p>

<p>The Apollo had already undergone a formative process,
and the ornaments of fancy had been embroidered
upon the tissue of an ancient tradition. After Homer’s
time, the function of animating and governing the Sun
was added to the multifarious offices of that deity. As
respects himself, this is a proof that his receptiveness
was not yet exhausted; that he was independent and
disengaged. As respects the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span>, this result shows
that there was some sympathy or moral gravitation,
which led to the absorption of this Homeric divinity in
Apollo.</p>

<p>The oscillating condition of that conception in the
Homeric poems, and the indeterminate state of its affinities,
will be considered in the next Section.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wide range of their functions.</i></div>

<p>In Homer the deities of invention are, without an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
exception, limited either to a single function (and this
in the great majority of cases), or to functions which
are connected, as in the case of Mercury, with one
common and central idea, itself such as may belong to
a mythological formation. But there is no such idea
on which, as on a string, we can possibly hang all the
various attributes of Homer’s Apollo: and the case
becomes stronger when we find that it is this very god,
already (if he be mythological only) quite overstocked,
who shows a yet further capacity to absorb into his
own person new powers of divinity, which in Homer’s
time as yet stood apart from him.</p>

<p>As respects mere multiplicity and diversity of function,
the case of Minerva is somewhat less marked than that
of Apollo: for it may be practicable to associate together
all her offices as they are described in Homer,
around one grand combination of Power with Wisdom,
as their central point. But even then, when we consider
that she supremely administers political society,
personal conduct, war, and skilled industry, in fact that
the whole intelligence of the world, individual and
collective, appears to be under her paramount guidance,
besides all the power she exercises over inanimate
and animate nature, and even in the innermost
sphere of personal action, we perceive that, apart from
the elevation and glory of her position, the range of
her gifts goes to an extent which, simply as such, could
never have been assigned by mere human invention to
any deity but the supreme one. The idea of the goddess
of Wisdom, conceived as largely as it must be in
order to cover all Minerva’s Homeric attributes, leaves
no room for the other conceptions necessary to fit out
a mythology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>For what a range do these attributes include!</p>

<p>Minerva is in heaven armed with such power that
to none of the gods, except Jove only, and to him
scarcely, does she succumb. She is supreme in war,
supreme in policy, supreme in art; supreme in prudence
and the practical business of life; supreme in
manual skill; supreme in or over all contests of force:
while at the same time the lower and executory parts
of each of these functions, where she drops them, are
taken up, as we have seen, by deities far inferior to
her, though still of the first or Olympian order. Even
physical strength, if combined with skill, is under her
supreme management: for it is through her aid that
Tydeus wins in the games at Thebes<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>, as well as Mecisteus
on another occasion, and that Nestor conquers
Ereuthalion<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>.</p>

<p>When Jupiter admonishes Venus to abandon attempts
at war, he adds<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>,</p>

       <div class="verse">ταῦτα δ’ Ἄρηϊ θοῷ καὶ Ἀθήνῃ πάντα μελήσει.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There can be no doubt which of these two war-divinities
was superior and which subordinate; the exploit
of Diomed alone would avail to settle the question:
but more direct evidence is to be found in the singular
passage which describes Minerva as invested with the
charge of chastising Mars, and in the mode after which,
in the Fifteenth and Twenty-first Books, she herself
recognises and fulfils the obligation of her office. (Il. v.
766. xv. 123&ndash;42).</p>

<p>Again, her name is connected with that of Vulcan
as to his own special and sole art of working in metals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Twice in the Odyssey the silversmith is introduced in
a simile, and he is called a man educated by these two<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Only in the arts of tissue and embroidery she seems to
have no coadjutor. This probably is on account of
their purely feminine character. But generally all the
principles and foundations of art are hers. Thus she
even teaches mensuration to the carpenter<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>As some of her distinctive epithets, like <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐρυσίπτολις,
φθισίμβροτος</span> refer especially to war, so she has others
which look either mainly or exclusively to the supreme
care of political order. Such are <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλαλκομένηις, λαόσσοος</span>,
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγελείη</span> (collector or leader of a people). It
is the executory duty that is intrusted to Themis. She
is the messenger, who summons the deities, and she
both collects and dissolves human assemblies<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>: thus
discharging a subordinate function, where Pallas is the
presiding goddess. It is probably for this reason that,
notwithstanding the strong political spirit of Homer,
we find Themis act so secondary a part in Olympus.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The central Wisdom of Minerva.</i></div>

<p>Thus Wisdom is the centre, and every thing that
flows forth from it is hers, whether in peace or war.</p>

<p>Over and above all these offices, which seem to have
a connection with her ordinary attributes, she appears
to share in the most recondite and peculiar functions
of other deities. She enters into Apollo’s knowledge
of the future; for in the Ithacan cave she foretells
to Ulysses all that he has yet to suffer. Her power
even descends, as we have seen, into the nether world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
It seems as if this power in the Shades were the portion
falling to her out of the supremacy over death, assigned
by tradition to the Messiah. And she has also, if not
the jurisdiction over death lodged peculiarly in her
hands, a faculty yet more wonderful ascribed to her,
that of staying its approach; for Euryclea bids Penelope
in her distress pray to Minerva, who can deliver
Telemachus from death; that is, can raise him up again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἡ γάρ κέν μιν ἔπειτα καὶ ἐκ θανάτοιο σαώσαι<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In truth it seems to be the distinctive character of
Minerva in the Homeric theo-mythology, that though
she is not the sole deity, yet the very flower of the
whole office and work of deity is every where reserved
for her: and though she is not directly invested with
the external form and body of every gift, yet she has
the heart, essence and virtue of them all; insomuch that,
practically, no limit can be placed upon her powers and
functions. The whole conception is therefore fundamentally
at variance with the measured and finite
organization of an invented system of religion, and by
its own incongruities with that system it proves itself
to be an exotic element.</p>

<p>By another path, we arrive at the very same conclusion
for Apollo. He too has much of that inwardness
and universality of function, which belongs to Minerva,
as well as a diversity of offices peculiarly his own. But
the argument here admits of being presented in a
different form. All his peculiar gifts in Homer are
referable to one of three characters, those of Prophet,
Deliverer, and Avenger, or Judge. In the first, gifted
with all knowledge, he is also the God of Song, which
was its vehicle. In the second, he is the hearer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
prayer, the healer of wounds, the champion of Heaven
itself against rebellion. In the third, he punishes the
guilty, and especially administers the one grand penal
law of death. All this he does as the organ of one,
with whom in will he is perfectly united. The tangled
thread runs out without knot or break, when we unravel
it by primitive Messianic tradition; because it was
fundamental in that tradition, that the person who was
the subject of it, should exhibit this many sided union
of character and function. But could Deliverance and
Destruction, there combined, any where else have been
read otherwise than as contradictory to one another, and
incapable of being united in the same being?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The conflicting Characters of Apollo.</i></div>

<p>I know no other principle, on which we can satisfactorily
explain either the double character of Apollo
as Saviour and as Destroyer, or the apparently miscellaneous
character of the attributes which successively
attached to him<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>. How strange in itself, that the God,
who alone has a peculiar office in bringing death, should
also be the God of deliverance from it! The contradiction
is harmonized by the supposition of a traditionary
origin, but otherwise it obstinately remains a contradiction.
Again, look at the nature of this peculiar relation.
Death by slow disease was not thought worthy to be
referred to the agency of a god, (Od. xi. 200.): the calm
death of old age, the sharp and agonizing death of a
plague, both these were so, and both are referred to
Apollo. How can this be, and what has become of the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
imaginative discrimination of the Greeks, and of their
love for logical consistency even in that domain, if we
suppose that in all this they were working by pure fancy?
Now the difficulty vanishes, if we suppose them to be
the mere utterers of the disjointed fragments of pristine
tradition, when they had lost the key to their common
meaning. For then, He that was to grind his enemies to
powder, was likewise to take the sting from death
itself, and to make the king of terrors gentle and humane.
Again, why was Apollo, thus associated with death,
likewise the god of foreknowledge? Why did he, and
he only, partake of this privilege with Jupiter? Nay,
he enjoyed knowledge apparently in a greater degree;
for we are not furnished with any case in which Apollo
is grossly deluded like Jupiter by Juno. Why, again,
should the god of foreknowledge be the god of
medicine? And why should the god of medicine also
absorb into himself the divinity of the sun, separate
from him in Homer, but afterwards identified with him?
Why does his character, as compared with that of the
other gods, approach to purity? As the dignity of
Minerva is explained by our supposing her to impersonate
the ancient traditions of the Wisdom; so in the
case of Apollo, we obtain a thread upon which each
and all of these otherwise incongruous notions may be
hung, if we suppose that he, after a certain severance
of those shades of character, which could only find expression
for a Greek in the female order, represented
the legendary anticipations of a person to come, in whom
should be combined all the great offices, in which God
the Son is now made known to man as the Light of
our paths, the Physician of our diseases, the Judge of
our misdeeds, and the Conqueror and disarmer, but not
yet abolisher, of death?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>They do not harmonize with Olympus.</i></div>

<p>Again, as these great deities are anomalies in themselves,
so are they likewise in the Olympian order.</p>


<p>If we were to remove Minerva and Apollo from
Olympus, we should indeed take away the breadth and
boldness of its sublimity, but we should add greatly to
its mere symmetry: especially as some other minor
figures would for the same reasons follow. There would
then remain there the polygamous monarch of the skies,
with his chief and secondary wives, the ranks of earth
supplying him from time to time with further satisfaction
for his passions; and in his various children or companions
would be represented the various essential functions, as
they were then estimated, of an organized community.
Themis would represent policy, Mercury gain, the
Muses song, and with it all knowledge; Vulcan, manual
skill; Mars, the soldier; Paieon, the surgeon; Venus,
that relaxed relation of the sexes to which mankind
has ever leaned. For corn there would be Demeter or
Ceres, and for wine, Dionysus or Bacchus. I grant that
there is here inserted one single ingredient not known
to the Homeric Olympus. His Muses are not stated to
have any foreknowledge. But, after allowing for this
trifling exception, I think it remains clear that though
the ethics and the poetry of that region would be
fatally damaged by the removal of Apollo and Minerva,
its mere statistics might be visibly improved.</p>

<p>The discussions which have arisen upon the etymology
of the name Apollo, are in themselves significant
of the difficulty of accounting for his origin mythologically.
Müller mentions the derivation from the
sun (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠϝέλιος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΑΠέλιος</span>) in order to reject it; as he repudiates
(and very justly) the whole theory, which treats
this deity as an elemental power. Passing over others
as unworthy of serious notice, he rejects <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπόλλυμι</span><a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
‘founded on a partial and occasional attribute of the
god,’ and adopts <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπέλλων</span> the <i>averter</i> (<i>sc.</i> of evil) or
defender, as most expressive of his general function:
in other words, though he does not go on to say so,
he is the darkened shadow of the Saviour. But the
really characteristic name of Apollo he conceives to
be <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Φοῖβος</span>, the bright and clear<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>. Clemens Alexandrinus,
in the <i>Stromata</i>, fancifully derives the name from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀ</span> <i>privative</i>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόλλων</span>, and interprets the name as
signifying the negation of plurality, and thus the unity
of the Godhead<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

<p>The name of Athene would appear to be formed by
transposition from the Egyptian Neith<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>, to whom, according
to ancient inscriptions, very high and comprehensive
dignities were assigned. It does not follow that
we are to regard the Athene of Homer as an Egyptian
divinity; though an Egyptian name may have been
the centre, around which gathered the remarkable and
even august fragments of the Messianic traditions
that we have found represented in her.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Summary of distinctive traits.</i></div>

<p>In quitting a subject of so much importance, I will
now endeavour to sum up, in the most concise form of
which it is susceptible, the evidence to be drawn from
Homer of the different position held by Apollo and
Minerva from that of the other Olympian deities.</p>

<p>I. Points of distinction in their relations to the
Olympian Court and its members.</p>

<p>1. The dignity accorded to them is quite out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
keeping with their rank, as belonging to the junior
generation of the mythological family, which was, as
such, inferior in rank and power to the senior one<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>.</p>

<p>2. They bear visible marks, even in the mythological
order, of an antiquity greater than that of the other
deities in general.</p>

<p>3. The external administration, or subordinate parts
of the functions assigned to them in the mythological
system, are commonly devolved upon another set of
deities, here called Secondaries.</p>

<p>4. A peculiar dignity, in the nature of precedence, is
accorded especially to Minerva.</p>

<p>5. We have next noted the singular union of Apollo
with Jupiter in will and affection, and the relation of
both to him, as the proper and regular ministers of the
supreme dispensations of heaven, apart from the partial
and individual action of particular gods.</p>

<p>6. The defence of heaven against rebellion is dimly
recorded to have been the act of Apollo; and indispensable
assistance was also rendered on another occasion
to Jupiter by Minerva.</p>

<p>7. These great divinities are never baffled, disgraced,
or worsted in any transaction between themselves and
any other deity; nor ever exhibited by the Poet in a
disadvantageous or disparaging position.</p>

<p>II. Points of distinction in their terrestrial relations
and their conditions of physical existence.</p>

<p>1. They were known by men to be entitled, either
alone, or in common with Jupiter only, to a peculiar
reverence or honour.</p>

<p>2. They were the objects of worship in all parts of
the Homeric world.</p>

<p>3. Neither of them are bound to any local residence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in particular; and for Apollo there is no trace of any
such residence at all.</p>

<p>4. They are both the objects, Minerva more particularly,
of general invocation and prayer, irrespective of
place and circumstances.</p>

<p>5. They are exempted from the chief physical limitations,
as of time, place, and perceptive organs, which are
generally imposed upon the deities of invention.</p>

<p>6. They have a separate and independent power to
punish those who offend them, without any need of an
appeal to Jupiter, or to the Olympian Court.</p>

<p>7. They are admitted, exclusively, or in common
with Juno only, to a share in certain peculiar mythological
functions of Jupiter himself.</p>

<p>8. They have a power of making revelations to men,
through signs or portents significant of the future.</p>

<p>9. They have a general power of extraordinary or
miraculous action upon nature, to which scarcely any
other deity approaches.</p>

<p>10. The peculiar and mysterious relation of Apollo,
with his sister Diana, to death, cannot be understood
or accounted for from mythological <i>data</i>.</p>

<p>11. In the exercise of their power over nature,
Minerva and Apollo are, more than other deities,
exempt from the need of resort to symbolic actions by
way of cooperative means.</p>

<p>III. Points of distinction with regard to their personal
characters.</p>

<p>1. Their moral tone is far superior to that of the
Olympian Court in general.</p>

<p>2. They are both peculiarly associated with Jupiter
in the original administration of Providential functions,
and are particularly concerned with the highest, most
ethical, and most inward parts of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Their relation to their mythological attributes is
different in kind from that of the ordinary Olympian
divinities.</p>

<p>4. They have a number and range of attributes
quite without parallel in the Olympian system: and
yet with this a capacity of receiving new ones.</p>

<p>5. Both in themselves, and in reference to that
system, the whole conception of Apollo and Minerva,
if it be viewed mythologically, is full of inexplicable
anomaly: and the only solution to be found is in the
recognition of the traditional basis, on which the Homeric
representations of them must be founded.</p>

<p>Although what I have built upon this evidence may
be termed an hypothesis, the whole of the evidence
itself is circumstantial: and I feel that the effect of it
is not only to draw a broad line, but almost to place
an impassable gulf, between such divinities as the
Homeric Minerva and Apollo, on the one hand, and
the Homeric Mars, Venus, Vulcan, and Mercury on
the other. The differences between them are, however,
graduated and shaded off by the interposition, first, of
the minor traditive deities, such as Latona and Diana;
and, secondly, of the greatest among the Olympian
personages chiefly or wholly mythological, such as
Neptune and Juno: and it is probably this graduation,
running through the Olympian body, which has
prevented our duly appreciating the immense interval
that lies between its extremes.</p>

<p>It is to the indefatigable students of Germany that
we, the less laborious English, are, along with the rest
of the world, indebted for what may be called the
systematic treatment of the Homeric poems with respect
to the facts they contain. To amass evidence is
one thing; to penetrate into its heart and spirit, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
another. The former without the latter is insufficient;
but the former is to the latter an indispensable preliminary.
The works of Homer should be viewed, and
their testimony registered, like the phenomena of a
geological period: so unencumbered is he with speculation
or the bias of opinion; so true, clear, direct, and
unmixed is his exhibition of historical and moral fact.
This method of investigation, honestly pursued, carries
with it an adequate and a self-acting provision for the
correction of its own errors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Explanation by Friedreich.</i></div>

<p>Since I commenced the examination of the question
now before us, there has appeared the second edition
of a work, which I believe to be the latest compendium
of what may be called the facts of the Homeric poems,
by J. B. Friedreich. I find that this writer has been
struck by the overpowering evidence of the vestiges of
an early revelation in the characters of the Homeric
Minerva and Apollo<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>. He observes the separate character
of their relations both to Jupiter and to mankind;
assigns to them an unbounded power over all
events and the whole of human life; and says, ‘This
Triad of Zeus, Athene, and Apollo, bears an unmistakeable
analogy to the Christian Trinity, of Father,
Holy Ghost, and Son: Jupiter answering to God the
Father, Athene to the Holy Ghost, and Apollo to the
Son of God, the Declarer of the will of His Heavenly
Father: like as, furthermore, the early Christians have
largely compared Christ with Apollo.’</p>

<p>In this representation I find a fundamental agreement
with the views expressed in the present work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
But I venture to think that the particular mode of the
relation between the Homeric and the primitive tradition,
which has been set forth in this work, is more
natural and probable than that asserted by Friedreich.
As it has been here represented, we are to consider the
primitive tradition as disintegrated and subdivided.
First, that of the Redeemer is severed from that of the
Holy Trinity. Next, its two aspects of the Wisdom and
the Messiah, become two impersonations. And then the
impersonation which represents the tradition properly
Messianic, is itself again subjected to duplication. As
the result of this threefold operation, we <span class="lock">have&mdash;</span></p>


<p>1. The trine Kronid brotherhood.</p>

<p>2. Minerva and Apollo.</p>

<p>3. Apollo and Diana.</p>

<p>The principle of the severance always being, to get
rid of some difficulty, encountered by the human apprehension
in embracing the integral tradition.</p>

<p>The difficulty at the first step was to reconcile equality,
or what the Christian dogma more profoundly terms
consubstantiality, with a ministerial manifestation.</p>

<p>The difficulty at the second step probably was to
combine in one impersonation two groups of images,
the one (the Wisdom), relating to function that dwells
purely in the Godhead; the other, to function containing
the element of humanity; it was, in short, to
grasp the doctrine, ‘One altogether; not by confusion
of Substance, but by unity of Person.’</p>

<p>The difficulty at the third step apparently was, as
has been stated, to associate the ideal of a strict and
severe chastity with any but a female nature.</p>

<p>There is no question now before us as to Apollo:
the point at issue is, whether we are to regard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Athene, or Minerva, of Homer as derived from traditions
of the Logos, or from traditions of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>I urge the former, for the following reasons:</p>

<p>1. Setting aside what was involved in the doctrine
of a Trinity (which is otherwise represented), we have
no evidence that there was any such substantive body
of primitive tradition respecting the Holy Spirit, as
would be likely to form the nucleus of a separate
mythological impersonation, and especially of one endowed
with such comprehensiveness, solidity, and
activity of function as Minerva. Whereas it appears
that there was that kind of substantive tradition with
respect to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λόγος</span>, the Word or Wisdom of God.</p>

<p>2. In the order of primitive tradition, the Son of
God would precede the Holy Spirit, as is the case in
the order of the Christian dogma; and the fragments
of such tradition, when carried into mythology, would
preserve and probably exaggerate, at any rate would not
invert, the relation. But in the Homeric mythology,
Minerva has a decided practical precedence over
Apollo, and above all, when they come into collision,
it is Apollo that yields, as in the incidents of the
Seventh and Tenth Iliads, and in the general issue of
the Trojan war.</p>

<p>3. But this difference is just what might be expected
to follow, upon the natural divergence of the two traditions
of the Word and the Incarnate Messiah respectively.
The latter, as more human, would take rank
after the former as more Divine.</p>

<p>4. We have also found a greater tendency on the
part of Minerva to act independently of Jupiter. This
is no unnatural diversion from the tradition of the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λόγος</span>, but it would be hard to connect ideally with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the Holy Spirit, who has not, in the ancient tradition,
the same amount or kind of separate development as
the Messiah.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Müller’s treatment of Apollo.</i></div>

<p>The functions of Apollo, and the nature, extent, and
history of his worship have been investigated at great
length by Müller, in the Second Book of his learned
and able History and Antiquities of the Doric race.
He has shown the immense importance of this deity
in Greek history and religion, reaching every where,
and embracing every object and purpose. He recognises
the apparent antagonism subsisting among his
infinitely varied functions; which he makes elaborate
and ingenious, but I think necessarily insufficient,
efforts to trace ideally to an union of origin within the
mythological system. His hypothesis, that the worship
of Apollo was wholly due to Dorian influence, requires
the support of the most violently strained assumptions;
as for example, that its prevalence, apparently at all
points, in Troas is to be accounted for by Cretan influences
there, which, at the most, tradition would only
warrant us in believing to have existed in a very contracted
form, and with influence altogether secondary.
Altogether, this sheer Dorianism of Apollo is at variance
with the whole spirit and effect of the Homeric
testimony; for in Homer the Dorians are insignificant
and undeveloped, while the power and worship of
Apollo had attained, as we have seen, to an extraordinary
height, and to the very broadest range. Again,
Müller<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> acknowledges the great difficulty of the dualism
presented to us by the figures, concurring as they
do in such remarkable functions, of Apollo and Diana:
a difficulty, which he seems to think incapable of full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
explanation. While attaching great value to his treatise,
I have the less hesitation in adopting conclusions
that he does not authorize, because his work is based in
some degree upon that (as I presume to think) defective
mode of appreciation of the Homeric as compared
with the later traditions, against which I have
ventured to protest, and from the consequences of
which it is one of my main objects to effect at least a
partial escape.</p>

<p>It will have appeared from this general account of
the traditive characters of Apollo and Minerva, that
the former represented the tradition of a person, and
the latter of an idea. Accordingly, the original character
of Apollo, which he bore during the infancy of
the mythical system, is in many points the more significantly
marked; as for example, by his share in the
War with the Giants, and by his mysterious relation
to Death.</p>

<p>But it was natural that, in the course of time, as
tradition in general grew weaker with the increasing
distance from its source, and as the inventive system enlarged
its development, those particular traditions, which
were self-explained by having their root in an intelligible
idea, should hold their ground much better than such
as had become mythical and arbitrary by having lost
their key. The traditional Minerva had an anchorage
in the great function of Wisdom; the traditional Apollo
had no support equal to this in breadth and depth; and
his attributes, the band of revelation being removed,
lost their harmony and could ill be held together.</p>

<p>Accordingly we find that in the later ages of the
mythology Apollo had lost much of what was transcendant
in his importance, but that Minerva retained her
full rank. One and the same Ode of Horace supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the proof of both. He places Apollo on a level not
only with Diana, but with Bacchus<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>:</p>

       <div class="verse indent16">Phœbe, sagittâ.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But, after having described the supreme and transcendant
dignity of Jupiter, he at once proceeds to place
Pallas before every other deity without exception<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>:</p>

       <div class="verse indent16">Pallas honores.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I will now pass on to consider the remaining vestiges
of original tradition perceivable in Homer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Diana of Homer.</i></div>

<p>Like the Moon to the Sun, an analogy maintained
by their respective assumption of the two characters in
the later mythology, Diana is a reflection, and in most
respects a faint reflection, of Apollo.</p>

<p>She was worshipped, says Müller<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>, in the character
of ‘as it were a part of the same deity.’ He collects
and reviews, from the whole circle of Greek history
and mythology, the points of coincidence between
them: and notices particularly, that like him she is
both <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λυκεία</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐλία</span>, both the destroyer and the preserver;
that she administers her office as angel of
Death, sometimes in wrath and sometimes without it;
and that her name Artemis, meaning, as he conceives,
healthy and uninjured, is in close correspondence with
those of Phœbus Apollo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is in conformity with what we gather from
the poems of Homer: but those poems have spared us
many of the confused and perplexing phenomena, which
are presented by the later mythology.</p>

<p>One side of the divided Messianic tradition, its purity,
is best represented in Diana, through her severe and spotless
chastity. Its force and scope are much more largely
developed in Apollo. But this high purity, and the double
aspect of the ministry of Death, appear to be of themselves
sufficient to stamp her beyond mistake with a
traditionary origin. Small resemblances, too, as well
as great ones, are traceable in Homer between her and
Apollo, such as her golden throne and golden distaff,
which may be compared to his golden sword, the sword
of primeval light: and even these minor correspondences
may in their own degree bear witness to the original
and integral shape of the tradition.</p>

<p>If she is thus clothed in a sort of lunar light, and is
in the main a reflection of Apollo upon earth, such we
may probably consider Persephone in the Shades<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.</p>

<p>Let us, however, consider what can be gathered from
Homer as to the attributes of Diana.</p>

<p>This deity would appear to have been, according
to him, a deity of universal worship. We may perhaps
safely infer thus much from the single fact of her
ministry of Death. She is also represented as extending
her agency to Troy, where she taught Scamandrius
to hunt<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>; probably to Crete, in the case of the daughters
of Pandareos; she is invoked in Ithaca by Penelope,
puts Ariadne to death in Dia, exercises a similar
function for the women in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Συρίη</span>, sends the Calydonian
boar for a defect of homage in Ætolia, and is fami<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>liarly
mentioned in connection with the Greeks generally,
while her place in the Theomachy may suffice to
mark her as also a Pelasgian goddess. In most points,
however, she partakes largely, as might be expected, of
the characteristics of the ordinary deities of invention.
Had she repeated all the chief notes of Apollo, and
with any thing like an equal force, the question of traditional
origin would perhaps have been more doubtful
than it now is.</p>

<p>When she is invoked by Penelope, it is in connection
with her share of the special ministry of death<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.
She is nowhere else made the object of prayer.</p>

<p>It is her deep resentment at the omission of sacrifice
which provokes her to send the Calydonian boar<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.
In the Fifth Iliad, she and her mother Latona appear
as deities purely subsidiary to Apollo. He deposits
Æneas in his temple: there, not in a temple of their
own, Latona and Diana attend upon and heal him<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Theomachy, she is treated with the same
ignominy as Mars and Venus, but by Juno instead of
Minerva. Her railing address to Apollo is conceived
in the lower and not in the higher spirit (Il. xxi.
472&ndash;7).</p>

<p>She never assumes a general power, either over man
in mind or body, or over outward nature.</p>

<p>She has no share in the general movement of either
poem, and is introduced in the great majority of instances
by way of allusion only.</p>

<p>Her near relation to Apollo gives a certain grandeur
to her position: but the inventive elements of the
representation greatly obscure and even partially overbear
the traditional.</p>

<p>Her side in the Trojan war is to be explained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
her relation to Apollo. In all other points she seems
to be a goddess of associations more properly Greek,
perhaps in consequence of their greater addiction to
hunting.</p>

<p>In treating the Homeric Diana as a personage principally
ancillary to Apollo, and equipped with reflections,
or stray fragments, of prerogatives chiefly belonging
to him, I do not attempt to foreclose the
question what may have been the origin of her name,
or whether she may be connected with any mythological
original in the religions of the East or of
Egypt.</p>

<p>Döllinger conceives that the union of Diana with
Apollo was Greek, and that they were not originally
in relation with one another; while he justly observes,
that this deity, like Apollo, has a great and inexplicable
diversity of function. She, like other deities
of Greece, has been thought to represent the Astarte
of the Syrians. Again, Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> has given us most
curious information respecting the gods of the Scythians,
whom we have found to be related to the
Pelasgi. They worship, he states, the Celestial Venus
under the name of Artimpasa. This name, it has
been ingeniously conjectured<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>, is composed (1) of the
name Mitra, which the Persians gave to Venus<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>, and
which reversed becomes Artim, and (2) of the Sanscrit
<i>Bhas</i>, meaning <i>shine</i>, and thus corresponding with the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Φοῖβος</span> of Apollo, and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γλαυκῶπις</span> of Pallas: all of
them being, as it were, shreds of the tradition fully
represented in the Shechinah of the Jews, and the
‘Light’ of Saint John. This also corresponds with the
cluster of golden epithets, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρυσηλάκατος, χρυσήνιος</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρυσόθρονος</span>, which Homer applies to Diana: and
the very feebleness of Diana in the Theomachy suggests
that the Eastern prototype of Venus, the Mitra of the
Persians, was originally no more than a degenerate derivation
from a higher tradition, which found a more
natural, but still only a partial, expression in the majestic
and chaste, as well as beautiful, Artemis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Latona of Homer.</i></div>

<p>We have next to consider the Homeric delineation
of Latona, the mother of Apollo and of Diana.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to avoid being struck, on
turning to this portraiture, with the contrast between
the slightness of the outline and the real dignity of
the features and position. This contrast, like the
greater one relating to Apollo, seems to have its key
in the traditional origin of the representation: and
there is no one Homeric deity, whose case, when fully
considered, can afford a more marked testimony to the
hypothesis of a strong element of traditive theology in
the religious system of the Poems.</p>

<p>Why has she a position so different from that of any
other wife or concubine of Jupiter: such, for example,
as Dione or Demeter?</p>

<p>Why is it so much elevated above that of any among
them, except only Juno?</p>

<p>How comes she to have a son so incomparably superior
in rank, in power, and in the affections of his father,
to any child of Juno herself, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρεσβὰ θεά</span>?</p>

<p>Why, being thus great, is she wholly unfurnished with
attributes or functions, either general or specific?</p>

<p>Why, on the other hand, does so much obscurity
hang about her origin, and what are we to say as to
her divinity, in answer to the question, whether it was
original or acquired?</p>

<p>The name of Latona appears to have been a per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>petual
puzzle to the expounders of Greek mythology.
It is taken to mean Night, which, combined with Day,
produces the Sun<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>; or ‘obscure,’ or ‘concealed,’ as
that from which issues the visible deity, the Sun in
heaven. But surely these explanations can have no
bearing upon the Homeric mythology, where it is
matter of question even whether Apollo and the Sun
have any mutual relations at all, and where it is quite
clear that the personality of Apollo is far older and
riper, as well as far higher and more comprehensive;
which implies of necessity, that Latona must have been
known, and must have held her place, quite apart from
any relation to the Sun. An explanation of this kind
is simply an indication, that the problem has not yet
been solved.</p>

<p>But now, if we presume Apollo to be the representative
of the Messianic tradition, that the Seed of the
woman should crush the serpent’s head, the state of
the case is entirely changed. And the explanation of
the name in particular, instead of being hopeless, becomes
easy, and even auxiliary to the general hypothesis.
For now Latona stands in the tradition as a person
anterior to the whole Olympian mythology: a person
for whose extraction that mythology does not and ought
not to account. Its Jupiter and Juno are referred
to a parentage, that of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ῥέα</span>, and through
these perhaps afresh to Oceanus and Tethys as their
ultimate source. Everything, again, that is connected
with the genesis of the Olympian system, properly so
called, is made to conform to anthropomorphous ideas:
but here are two of its deities, one of them among its
very greatest, who have a mother that forms part of
the earliest known tradition respecting them, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that mother is herself without an origin. What could
be more natural, than that a name should fasten itself
upon her, simply importing that, illustrious as was her
motherhood, the fountain-head of her own life and
destiny was lost in oblivion? For it lay beyond the
point from which all mythical knowledge was held to
spring. A certain motherhood was known of her, and
that was all.</p>

<p>Again, the mother of the Deliverer was to be a
woman. But in the Greek mythology it could not be,
that a woman should stand as the giver of life to one
of its most august divinities. Yet the woman of the
tradition could not be transferred from the tradition as
a great substantive personage into the Greek mythology,
because in the tradition she stood an unembellished
figure, wholly without attributes. Hence invention
would, on taking over the tradition, be at fault;
and could not but present to us an ambiguous and inconsistent
picture, such as now stands before us in the
Latona of Homer.</p>

<p>Let us next set forth the facts regarding Latona, as
they stand in the poems.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, her divinity is beyond all
doubt; for she is one of those deities who take part in
the war<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>, and this although, almost alone among them,
she has no office whatever to associate her with it, and
no part to play in the conduct of it. She ranges herself
on the side of the Trojans; apparently, like Diana,
drawn in that direction by Apollo, the central and
really important figure of the group. While Venus,
who appears in the first enumeration, is omitted in the
array<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> of deities for action, Latona has Mercury assigned
to her for an antagonist. And, when the crisis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
comes, we observe in her case a marked instance of
that care, with which Homer preserves her, like the
greater traditive deities, from anything like discredit.
Mercury declines the combat, on the ground that it is
hard to fight against the wives of Jupiter; and tells
her she is at liberty to announce that she has vanquished
him. Whence has this pale and colourless
figure such very high honour so jealously asserted for
her<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>?</p>

<p>When Niobe, proud of her numerous offspring, taunts
Latona as the mother of only two children, summary
and awful punishment follows: the children are slain,
the unhappy mother is turned to stone. Yet she herself
takes no part in the vengeance, a fact remarkably
in harmony with her place as defined by the primitive
tradition of Holy Scripture. Of the three or four
suffering figures in the Shades, only one has the cause
of his punishment stated, and it is much the severest of
all. It is Tityus, whose entrails are continually devoured
by vultures, because he offered violence to Latona as she
was going to the Pythian temple of her son.</p>

<p>When, in the Fourteenth Iliad, Jupiter recites the
mothers of certain of his offspring, beginning with
women and ending with goddesses, Latona appears in
the latter category, after Ceres and before Juno: and,
as the scale is an ascending one, she must clearly rank
before the first and next to the last named deity.</p>

<p>There are, however, various indications that this had
not always been so: but that, according to original tradition,
she had been of the human order, and had undergone
a sort of translation into the ranks of the Immortals.</p>

<p>The first of these is the taunt of Niobe. The boast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of richer fecundity is natural in a human mother’s
mouth, as against another mother reputed to be
human<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>; but entirely strange and absurd, if we suppose
it directed against a deity. Dione and Demeter
have but one child each. Nor is there a
marked difference in this respect between the Latona
and the Juno of Homer; for Juno’s children are but
two, or at most three<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.</p>

<p>Next, we can account for the origin and parentage
of all the great Olympian deities of Homer, with the
single exception of Latona. She is no one’s daughter,
no one’s sister: but is a wife (that also equivocally), and
a mother only. When, indeed, we part company with
Homer, the scene changes, and a father is found for
her in the Hymns: she is the daughter, according to
one reading, of Saturn,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">κυδίστη θύγατερ μεγάλοιο Κρόνοιο<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In Hesiod she is the daughter of a Titan: but even
here she retains this mark of a most ancient tradition,
that she is said to have been married to Jupiter before
the great Juno<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>: though she comes after Metis, or
Wisdom, the oldest of all his consorts; an order not
at variance with the traditional ideas.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her anomalous position in mythology.</i></div>

<p>But there must have been some cause or process
that brought her into the Homeric Olympus, an anomaly
alike among mortals and Immortals. What could
it have been, except an illustrious maternity, to account
for her elevation, and at the same time her
original womanhood to account for the blank in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
descent and consanguinity, and for her total want of
attributes?</p>

<p>It must be granted that there is a certain degree
of resemblance between Latona and Dione: turning
mainly upon this, that Dione seems to be in Olympus
without either dignity or power, and simply as the vehicle,
through which her daughter Venus was brought
into existence. But then the want of basis is in her
case immediately made evident by results. Even in
Homer she is not among the gods of the Theomachy;
nor is she named among the mothers in the Fourteenth
Book; and Hesiod, though she is invoked in the suspected
Proem of his Theogony, entirely passes her
over in the body of it, and furnishes Venus with another
origin. She remains all but a cipher ever after.</p>

<p>Again, the epithets attached to Latona are such as
to leave her, and her alone among all deities of such
dignity, wholly functionless, and also wholly inactive. I
distinguish the two, because Juno has only a limited
function, but she has power, and an immense activity.
Latona has beauty and majesty, qualities which
appertain to every goddess as such: she is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλλιπάρῃος</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐπλόκαμος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλλιπλόκαμος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρυσοπλόκαμος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠΰκομος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυδρὴ</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πότνια</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐρικύδης</span>: and we may observe in the more
personal portion of these epithets how Homer, with his
usual skill, has avoided placing her in any kind of
rivalry with Juno, who is usually praised for her eyes
and arms, not her cheeks and hair. But they all leave
her void of purpose; and she must stand as a sheer
anomaly, unless there is some better explanation of her
being and place in mythology, than mythology itself
can supply.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her relation to primitive Tradition.</i></div>

<p>Even in the later tradition, Latona never gains a
definite office: she remains all along without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
meaning or purpose intrinsic to herself: she shines
only in the reflected glory of her offspring, and is commonly
worshipped only in union with them<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>. If therefore
it has been shown, that the mythological character
of Apollo is clearly the vehicle of the ancient tradition,
known to us in the Book of Genesis, respecting the Seed
of the woman, it seems plain that in Latona is represented
the woman from whom that Seed was to spring.</p>

<p>I do not presume to enter into the question whether
we ought to consider that the Latona of Homer represents
the Blessed Virgin, who was divinely elected
to be the actual mother of our Lord; or rather our
ancient mother Eve, whose seed He was also in a peculiar
sense to be.</p>

<p>So far as personal application is concerned, the same
arguments might be used upon the subject, as upon
the interpretation of the original promise recorded in
Scripture: and the question is one rather of the interpretation
of Scripture, than of Homer. The relation
which appears to me to be proved from the text of the
poems, is between the deity called Latona and the
fifteenth verse of the third chapter of Genesis. As to
all beyond this, I should suppose it perhaps more just
to regard her as a typical person, exhibiting through
womanhood the truth of our Blessed Lord’s humanity,
than as the mere representative of any individual personage.</p>

<p>Backward as is the position of Latona in the practical
religion of Homer, the universal recognition of the
deity is sufficiently established: on the one hand by
her place among the deities of the Trojan party; on
the other, by the punishment of Niobe for an offence
against her either in Greece, or at the least in a re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>cognised
Greek legend; by the punishment of Tityus;
and by her inclusion in the Catalogue of the Fourteenth
Iliad.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her slightness of action.</i></div>

<p>To this very remarkable deity no utterance of any
kind is ever ascribed by Homer, and with, I think,
three small exceptions, nothing of personal and individual
action. Even when she takes her place among
the deities in the array of battle, it is not said that she
stood up against Mercury, but simply that Mercury
stood up against her<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>.</p>

<p>The three cases are as follows. First, when he makes
over to her the victory in waiving the fight, she offers
no reply; but simply picks up her daughter Diana’s
bow and arrows, and goes after her, apparently with
the intention of offering her comfort. The next
action<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> attributed to her is this: that when Apollo<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
has carried the bruised and stunned Æneas into his
temple on Pergamus, Latona and Diana tend him
there. Thus both of these actions exhibit her in strict
ideal subordination, so to speak, to one of her children,
as though by tradition she existed only for them. But
the second is especially remarkable, and alike illustrative
of the traditional basis of the Mother and of the
Son.</p>

<p>In the first place, as it appears to me, there can
hardly be a circumstance more singular, according to
the principles of the Greek mythology, than that any
one deity should be introduced as acting, not in her
own temple, but in the temple of another. Such however
is here the case with Latona and Diana in the
temple of Apollo.</p>

<p>Next, they are acting as purely ministerial to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
They do not enter into the fray: it is he who has been
there, and who, having deposited Æneas, immediately
prosecutes the affairs of the battle-field, while they, as
his satellites, give effect to his purpose in setting about
the restoration of the disabled warrior.</p>

<p>Lastly, the significance of this action is raised to the
highest point, when we recollect that this is a mother
executing the design of her son. Latona’s action in
the Twenty-first Book, like that of Dione with Venus,
can be accounted for by her maternal character. But
there is no case in the Homeric poems besides this,
where we see a parent-god thus acting ministerially in
the execution of the plans of his or her offspring. The
primeval tradition, once admitted as the basis of the
mythological group, furnishes us with the key to what
would otherwise be another great anomaly.</p>

<p>The third case is in entire harmony with the other
two. Tityus, the son of Earth, is tortured in the nether
world for having offered violence to Latona, and the
crime was committed when she was on her way through
Panopeus to Delphi. This was probably the route from
Delos to that place: so that again the poet seems to
represent Latona in close but subordinate connection
with her son, by making her travel between the seats
of his two already famous oracles.</p>

<p>Apollo, then, with Latona and Diana, forms a group;
and the origin of the combination is to be sought in
primitive tradition. It is not necessary to show that
the personages thus associated maintained their association
in all the religions of the East. I admit that we
are not to suppose, that the idea of this combination
passed direct from the patriarchs into Greece. The
most natural place in which to seek for traces of it
would be, in the religion of the Persians, anterior to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
time of Homer. Unfortunately we have no accounts of
it at any such date. But our failing to find these three
deities in a company, or to find any germ which might
have been developed into that company, in accounts
later by probably five or six centuries at least, raises
no presumption whatever against the hypothesis that
we may owe the representation, as it stands in
Homer, to historical derivation through the forefathers
of the Hellic tribes, from some such period as
that when, for example, Abraham dwelt in Ur of the
Chaldees<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Iris of Homer.</i></div>

<p>Iris, the messenger goddess, the last, and also by much
the least important of the personages to whom I ascribe
a traditive origin, is perhaps not the least clear in her
title to it.</p>

<p>Her title to rank as one of the deities of the ordinary
Olympian assemblage is not subject to doubt.
It depends partly on the fact that she is always at hand
there. But it is established more distinctly still by the
passage, which represents her as carrying to the palace
of Zephyr the prayer of Achilles. She finds the Winds
engaged in a banquet, and they eagerly solicit her to
sit and feast with them. She answers them, like one
desirous to escape from second-rate into first-rate company,
to the effect that she has not time: the Ethiopians
are just about supplying the greater gods with a banquet
from their hecatombs; and she must repair to that
quarter accordingly, as otherwise she will lose her share
of the offerings<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>.</p>

<p>With respect to her position generally, we have no
mark of her being foreign; and all the traditive deities,
it may be observed, are sufficiently, though not exclusively
national. Again, we have no mark of her being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
recent; on the contrary, she is without parents, and this,
though not conclusive, is a sign to the opposite effect.</p>

<p>Iris has no original action whatever, but is simply a
willing servant of other deities; nor does she disdain
spontaneously to officiate on behalf of a distinguished
human object of their favour, like Achilles<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>. Only once
have we an account of her bringing an order without
the name of the sender: it is when she appears to
Helen, and exhorts her to repair to the Wall<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>. She is
not, however, said even in this place to act on her own
account; and we ought probably to understand that,
according to the general rule, she comes from Jupiter.
It is added, that she inspired Helen with a longing
sentiment towards her former husband and country,
but this, as is most likely, is meant simply to describe
the effect of her words in the ordinary manner of their
operation on the understanding. This ancillary character
of Iris is exactly what she would bear, if her
origin really lay in the primitive tradition of the
rainbow.</p>

<p>But what seems decisively to establish her relation
to that tradition is, that she is firmly connected in
Homer with two things that have in themselves no
connection whatever, and between which that ancient
tradition is the only link.</p>

<p>In the first place, her identity of name is the witness
to her original connection with the rainbow<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>: which,
however, as a standing and ordinary phenomenon of
nature, did not bear, apart from positive appointment,
in any manner the character of a messenger: and hence
we find that by disintegration the two ideas had been
entirely separated before the time of Homer, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
name itself is the only remaining witness in the poems
to their having been at some former period associated.
The function of the messenger was kept in action by
the occasions of the Olympian family and polity. In
this manner, as the stronger of the two ideas, it held its
ground, and took possession of the personal Iris, while
the rainbow, though still conceived of as a sign to
mortals<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>, appears to have been regarded as separate.</p>

<p>Of the character of the messenger we find that Iris
had so completely become the model, that her name,
only modified into Iros, is given to Arnæus, the ribald
and burly beggar of the Odyssey, only because he was
a go-between, or errand-carrier:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">οὕνεκ’ ἀπαγγέλλεσκε κιὼν, ὅτε πού τις ἀνώγοι<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The hypothesis, then, of traditional origin is the key,
and the only key, to the position of the Homeric Iris.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Atè of Homer.</i></div>

<p>Before quitting the precinct of the primeval tradition
discoverable in Homer, we have yet one very
remarkable group of impersonations to consider, that in
which the goddess <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> is the leading figure. Commonly
regarded as meaning Mischief, the word is not
capable of being fully rendered in English: but Guile
is its primary idea, in the train of which come the
sister notions of Folly and Calamity.</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> both wishes and suggests all ill to mortals; but
she does not seem in Homer to have any power of
injuring them, except through channels, which have
been wholly or partially opened to her by their own
volition.</p>

<p>The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> of the later Greeks is Calamity simply,
with a shadow of Destiny hanging in the distance; as
in the magnificent figure of the lion’s cub in Æschylus<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
But the word never bears in Homer the sense of calamity
coming simply from without. This is evident
even from the large and general description, where she
appears in company with the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λιταί</span><a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>. Vigorous and
nimble, she ranges over the whole earth for mischief.
After her, slowly lag the Prayers or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λιταὶ</span>, honoured
however in being, like her, daughters of Jupiter. These
are limping, decrepit, and unable to see straight before
them. The leading idea of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> is not force, but
cunning. She is the power that tempts and misleads
men to their own cost or ruin, as they afterwards find
out. Nay, she tempts the deity also: for she beguiles
even Jupiter himself<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> when Hercules is about to be
born, and induces him thoughtlessly to promise what
will, through Juno’s craft, overturn his own dearly
cherished plans. For this excess of daring, however,
she herself suffers. Jupiter seizes her by the hair, and
hurls her from Olympus, apparently her native seat.
Thenceforward she can only exercise her function
among men; who, when they have yielded to the seduction,
and tasted the ashes under the golden fruit, at
length set about repentance or prayer:</p>

<p>Now though the impersonation of Atè in Homer is
one of the indeterminate class, it is surely a mistake to
treat it as representing the mere poetical incorporation
of an abstract idea. On the contrary, we seem to find
in it the old tradition of the Evil One as the Tempter;
and it may be said that the word Temptress would best
represent the Homeric idea of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span>. In this sense it will
supply a consistent meaning to the fine passage in the
speech of Phœnix: for we are swift, so says the Poet, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
fall into temptation, and to offend, ingenious only in not
seeing our fault, and covering it with excuses: but slow,
and like the half-hearted, decrepit <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λιταί</span>, when we have
to make our entreaties for pardon, and to think of restitution
and amendment. Yet as even the gods listen
to their entreaties, ‘so,’ says Phœnix, ‘shouldst thou, O
Achilles: and if thou dost not, then mayest yet thyself
fall.’ But if <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> meant only misfortune, the passage
loses all its harmony, and even becomes absurd; for
surely none will say that men are slow to discern adversity,
or to offer petitions, wherever they have a prospect
of being heard, for relief from it.</p>

<p>There is no passage which appears to me more characteristic
of the true distinctive character of the Homeric
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span>, than that in which Dolon confesses his
folly<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">πολλῇσίν μ’ ἄτῃσι παρὲκ νόον ἤγαγεν Ἕκτωρ.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here we have Hector, the tempter: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄται</span>, the
temptation: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόος</span>, the sound mind, from which temptation
diverted the self-duped simpleton: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἤγαγεν</span>, expressive
of the medium, namely, through volition, and
not by force.</p>

<p>The elements combined in the idea of the Homeric
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span>, and the conditions of her action, may be presented
together as follows:</p>

<p>1. She takes the reins of the understanding and
conduct of a man.</p>

<p>2. She effects this not by force from without, but
through the medium of his own will and inward consent,
whether unconscious or express.</p>

<p>3. Under her dominion he commits offences against
the moral law, or the law of prudence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<p>4. These offences are followed by his retributive
sufferings.</p>

<p>The function of the Tempter is here represented
with great precision; but two essential variations have
come to be perceptible in the idea taken as a whole.</p>

<p>The first, that this <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> is herself sometimes prompted
or sent by others, as by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρίνυς</span>, (Od. xv. 234,) or by
her with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μοῖρα</span>, as in Il. xix. 87. And accordingly
she too is a daughter, nay, the eldest daughter,
of Jupiter himself<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.</p>

<p>The second variation is this: that offences against
the mere law of prudence find their way into precisely
the same category with sins; or, in other words, the
true idea of sin had been lost. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> the person, and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη</span> the effect, are, moreover, frequently blended by
the Poet.</p>

<p>Among the principal <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄται</span> of Homer are those,</p>

<p>1. Of Jupiter, Il. xix. 91&ndash;129.</p>

<p>2. Of Dolon, Il. x. 391; leading him to accept the
proposal of Hector.</p>

<p>3. Of Melampus, Od. xv. 233, 4, causing him to
undertake an enterprise beyond his means on account
of the daughter of Neleus.</p>

<p>All of which are against the law of prudence and
forethought.</p>

<p>4. Of Agamemnon, Il. xix. 88, 134&ndash;8.</p>

<p>5. Of Paris, Il. vi. 356, xxiv. 28.</p>

<p>6. Of Helen, Od. iv. 261. xxiii. 223.</p>

<p>7. Of manslaughter, Il. xxiv. 480.</p>

<p>8. Of the drunken centaur Eurytion, who had his
ears and nose cut off for his excesses, Od. xxi.
296&ndash;302.</p>

<p>In one place only of Homer, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη</span> seems to mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
calamity not imputable to the sufferer’s fault, further
than by some slight want of vigilance. This is the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη</span>
charged upon Ulysses, when his companions destroy the
oxen of the Sun, Od. xii. 372. At least he had no
further share in that matter than that, by going to
sleep, he left his comrades to act for themselves.</p>

<p>The long continued misconduct of the Suitors is never
described as their <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη</span>: probably because the word properly
signifies a particular temptation followed by a particular
act, rather than a continued course of action.</p>

<p>This, again, serves the more closely to associate <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span>
with the primitive tradition of the Fall of Man.</p>

<p>The higher form of human wickedness, which is
attended with deliberate and obstinate persistence in
wrong, is not <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη</span> but <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτασθαλίη</span>. Such is the wickedness
of Ægisthus and of the Suitors; such also that of
the Giants. The same phrase is applied to the crew of
Ulysses, who devoured the oxen of the Sun<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>: and this
appears to conform to the view taken of their offence in
the poems, however anomalous that view itself may be.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Other traditions of the Evil One.</i></div>

<p>I will now gather into one view the dispersed
fragments of tradition concerning the Evil One which
seem to be discernible in Homer.</p>

<p>1. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> is the first, and the one which comes nearest
to presenting a general outline.</p>

<p>2. A second is found in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span><a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>, who aims at the
destruction of Godhead in its supreme representatives,
and is thrust down to Tartarus by Jupiter. And we
may here observe an important distinction.</p>

<p>Some persons, like Tityus, offend against a particular
person who had taken a place in the Olympian Court;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
or else, apparently like Orion, offend the gods in general
by their presumption. They are punished in the Shades.
But those who have aimed at the dethronement or destruction
of Godhead itself are in the far deeper darkness
of Tartarus<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>. I suggest this as a possible explanation
of the double place of punishment; which is otherwise
apparently a gross solecism in the Homeric system.</p>

<p>3. To the latter class of offenders belong the Titans,
who most pointedly represent the element of Force in
the ancient traditions, while <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> embodies that of
Guile.</p>

<p>These are the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ ὑποταρτάρεοι</span>, or the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνέρτεροι</span>, or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔνερθε θεοὶ</span>, who form the infernal court of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνον
ἄμφις ἐόντες</span> (Il. xiv. 274, 9. xv. 225). They are evidently
themselves in a state of penal suffering; but they must
also have the power of inflicting the severest punishment
on some other offenders; for they, and not Aides
or Persephone, seem to be the persons called to be witnesses
of the solemn oath for the avoidance of perjury,
taken by Juno in the Fourteenth Book<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>.</p>

<p>4. Of these Titans two are apparently named in the
persons of Otus and Ephialtes, children of Neptune.</p>

<p>5. To the same class, in all probability, belong the
Giants, led by Eurymedon, and born of the same
mythological father. Od. vii. 58.</p>

<p>6. It is likely that Typhoeus may have been of the
same company; for although he is not stated to be in
Tartarus, yet his position corresponds with it in the
essential feature of being under the earth. (Il. ii. 782.
viii. 14). Homer does not indeed expressly say, that
Otus and Ephialtes were Titans, nor that Eurymedon
was of the same band; nor yet that the Titans were
rebels against heaven. But his images are so com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>bined
round certain points as to make this matter of
safe and clear inference.</p>

<p>For the Titans are in Tartarus, and are with and
attached to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>, whom Jupiter thrust down thither.
And the giants under Eurymedon, for their mad audacity,
are driven to perdition<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>. Lastly, Otus and Ephialtes,
who made war upon heaven, and whom Apollo
quelled, not appearing, like their mother Iphimedea, in
the Shades of the Eleventh Odyssey, can only be in
Tartarus<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>.</p>

<p>From the scattered traditions we may collect and
combine the essential points. In Otus and Ephialtes
the rebellion is clearly stated, and in Eurymedon it is
manifestly implied. In the Titans, who are called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ</span>,
and in their association with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>, as also in the
high parentage of the others, we have the celestial
origin of the rebels. In the hurling down of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>
to Tartarus, we have the punishment which they all are
enduring, immediately associated with an act of supreme
retribution.</p>

<p>7. Elsewhere will be found a notice of the singular
relation, which may be traced between Neptune and
the tradition of the Evil One. This relation is mythological
in its basis: but it seems to proceed upon the
tradition, that the Evil One was next to the Highest.</p>

<p>8. A more recent form of the tradition concerning
the great war in heaven seems to be found in the revolt
of the Immortals of Olympus, headed by Juno,
Neptune, and Minerva, against Jupiter, which was put
down by Briareus or Ægæon of the hundred hands.</p>

<p>Who this Ægæon was, we can only conjecture: he
is nowhere else named in Homer. From his having
a double name, one in use among gods, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
among mortals, it might be conjectured that the immediate
source of this tradition was either Egypt, or
some other country having like Egypt an hieratic and
also a demotic tongue. In its substance, it can hardly
be other than a separate and dislocated form of the
same idea, according to which we see Apollo handed
down as the deliverer of Olympus from rebellion. The
expression that <i>all</i> men (Il. i. 403.) call him Ægæon,
tends to universalize him, and thus to connect him
with Apollo. He is also (v. 403.) a son of Jupiter,
avowedly superior to him in strength:</p>

       <div class="verse">ὁ γὰρ αὖτε βίῃ οὗ πατρὸς ἀμείνων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Citations from Holy Scripture.</i></div>

<p>It is perhaps worth while to notice the coincidence
between the language of Homer as to the Giants, and
that of the Books of the Ancient Scriptures. Homer
says of Eurymedon<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὅς ποθ’ ὑπερθύμοισι Γιγάντεσσιν βασίλευεν·</div>
       <div class="verse">ἀλλ’ ὁ μὲν ὤλεσε λαὸν ἀτάσθαλον, ὤλετο δ’ αὐτός.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Either the rebellion, or the punishment in hell, of a
wicked gang under the name of Giants is referred to
in the following passages of the Old Testament and
the Apocrypha. The allusion is not made evident, as to
the former set of passages, in the Authorized Version;
I therefore quote from the Septuagint or the Vulgate.</p>

<p>1. Job xxvi. 5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecce gigantes gemunt sub aquis, et qui
habitant cum eis.</i> Vulgate. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μὴ γίγαντες μαιωθήσονται
ὑποκάτωθεν ὕδατος καὶ τῶν γειτόνων αὐτοῦ</span>; LXX.</p>

<p>2. Prov. ii. 18. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔθετο γὰρ παρὰ τῷ θανάτῳ τὸν οἶκον
αὐτῆς, καὶ παρὰ τῷ ἅδῃ μετὰ τῶν γηγένων τοὺς ἄξονας αὐτῆς</span>.
LXX.</p>

<p>3. Prov. xxi. 16. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vir, qui erraverit a viâ doctrinæ, in
cœtu gigantum commorabitur.</i> Vulg. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνὴρ πλανώμενος
ἐξ ὅδου δικαιοσύνης ἐν συναγωγῇ γιγάντων ἀναπαύσεται</span>.
LXX.</p>

<p>See Gen. vi. 4, 5: in which we perhaps see the original
link between the Giants, and the rebellion of
the fallen angels described by St. Jude, ver. 6: ‘And
the angels which kept not their first estate, but
left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting
chains under darkness unto the judgment of the
great day.’</p>

<p>We have also the corresponding declaration of St.
Peter: ‘God spared not the angels that sinned, but
cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains
of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; and spared
not the old world<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>.’</p>

<p>Again, in the Apocryphal Books.</p>

<p>1. Wisdom xiv. 6. ‘In the old time also, when the
proud giants perished, the hope of the world, governed
by thy hand, escaped in a weak vessel.’ Auth.
Version.</p>

<p>2. Ecclus. xvi. 7. ‘He was not pacified toward the
old giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishness.’
Auth. Version.</p>

<p>3. Baruch iii. 26, 8. ‘There were giants famous from
the beginning.... But they were destroyed, because they
had no wisdom, and perished through their own foolishness.’
Auth. Version.</p>

<p>We thus appear to find in Homer many displaced
fragments of the old traditions of the Bible with respect
to the Evil One. In the later Greek and the
Roman literature, the traditions on the same subject
had almost entirely lost their likeness to their original.
The figure of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span>, and the idea of spiritual danger to
man through guile tempting him extrinsically but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>wardly,
entirely disappears. There remains only the
recollection of a contest waged by brute force, and a
solitary remnant of forgotten truth in the fame still
adhering to Apollo, that he had been the deliverer
and conqueror, who in the critical hour vindicated
the supremacy of heaven. In the time of Horace
even this recollection had become darkened and confused.</p>

<p>From the Homeric traditions of the Evil One and
the fallen angels, we may properly pass to those of a
future state, which involves, partially at least, the idea
of retribution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Future State in Homer.</i></div>

<p>The representations of the future state in Homer
are perhaps the more interesting, because it may be
doubted whether they are, logically, quite consistent
with one another. For this want of consistency becomes
of itself a negative argument in support of the
belief that, as they are not capable of being referred to
any one generative idea or system, they may be distorted
copies or misunderstood portions of primitive
truth.</p>

<p>Another reason for referring them to this origin
appears to be found in their gradual deterioration after
the time of Homer. In his theology, future retribution
appears as a real sanction of the moral law. In the
later history, and generally in the philosophy of Paganism,
it has lost this place: practically, a phantasmagoria
was substituted for what had been at least a
subjective reality: and the most sincere and penetrating
minds thought it absurd to associate anything
of substance with the condition of the dead<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>. The
moral ideas connected with it appear before us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
descending series; and thus they point backwards to
the remotest period for their origin and their integrity.</p>

<p>Lastly, it would appear that the traditions themselves
present to us features of the unseen world, such,
in a certain degree, as Divine Revelation describes.</p>

<p>That world appears to us, in Homer, in three divisions.</p>

<p>First there is the Elysian plain, apparently under
the government of Rhadamanthus, at which Menelaus,
as the favoured son-in-law of Jupiter, is to arrive. It
is, physically at least, furnished with all the conditions
of repose and happiness.</p>

<p>Next there is the region of Aides or Aidoneus, the
ordinary receptacle even of the illustrious dead, such
as Achilles, Agamemnon, and the older Greek heroes
of divine extraction. Hither, if we may trust the
Twenty-fourth Odyssey, are carried the Suitors; and
here is found the insignificant Elpenor (Od. xi. 51).</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is the region of Tartarus, where <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἰάπετος</span> reign. This is as far below Aides, as the
heaven is upwards from the earth<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>.</p>

<p>There appears to be some want of clearness in the
division between the second region and the third as to
their respective offices, and between the second and the
first as to their respective tenants.</p>

<p>The realm of Aides is, in general, not a place of
punishment, but of desolation and of gloom<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>. The shade
of Agamemnon weeps aloud with emotion and desire
to clasp Ulysses: and Ulysses in vain attempts to console
Achilles, for having quitted ‘the warm precincts of
the cheerful day.’ But though their state is one of
sadness, neither they nor the dead who are named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
there are in general under any judicial infliction. It
is stated, indeed, that Minos<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> administers justice
among them; but we are not told whether, as seems
most probable, this is in determining decisively the
fate of each, or whether he merely disposes, as he
might have done on earth, of such cases as chanced
to arise between any of them for adjudication.</p>

<p>The only cases of decided penal infliction in the
realm of Aides are those of Tityus, Sisyphus, and Tantalus.
Castor and Pollux, who appear here, are evident
objects of the favour of the gods<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>. Hercules, like
Helen of the later tradition, is curiously disintegrated.</p>

<p>His <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴδωλον</span> meets Ulysses, and speaks as if possessed
of his identity: but he himself (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς</span>) is enjoying reward
among the Immortals. The latter of these images
represents the laborious and philanthropic side of the
character attributed to him, the former the reckless
and brutal one. Again it might be thought that the
reason for the advancement of Menelaus to Elysium,
while Castor and Pollux belong to the under-world,
was the very virtuous character of that prince. He is,
however, not promoted thither for his virtues, but for
being the son-in-law of Jupiter by his marriage with
Helen. And thus again, the son-in-law of Jupiter is,
as such, placed higher than his sons.</p>

<p>The proper and main business of Tartarus is to serve
as a place of punishment for deposed and condemned
Immortals. There were Iapetos and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>, there the
Titans<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>: there probably Otus and Ephialtes, who not
only wounded Mars but assaulted Olympus<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>: there
too, were Eurymedon and the Giants, who perished by
their <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτασθάλιαι</span>. Thither it is that Jupiter threatens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to hurl down offensive and refractory divinities<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>. Direct
rebellion against heaven seems to be the specific offence
which draws down the sentence of relegation to Tartarus.
Still in the Third Iliad Agamemnon invokes
certain deities, as the avengers of perjury upon man<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>It is not clear whether this passage implies that all
perjurors are punished in Tartarus; or whether Aidoneus,
Persephone, and the Erinues are the subterraneous
deities here intended: but as the Titans are
elsewhere only mentioned in express connection with
Tartarus, and from the description of the Erinues in
Il. xix. 259, I incline to the latter opinion.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, there is some confusion between
these compartments, so to speak, of the invisible world.
The realm of Aidoneus seems to partake, in part, of the
character both of Tartarus and of the Elysian plain.
In common with the former, it includes persons who
were objects of especial divine favour. In common
with Tartarus, it is for some few, at least, a scene of
positive punishment.</p>

<p>Still, if we take the three according to their leading
idea, they are in substantial correspondence with divine
revelation. There is the place of bliss, the final destination
of the good. There is the place of torment,
occupied by the Evil One and his rebellious companions:
and there is an intermediate state, the receptacle
of the dead. Here, as might be expected, the
resemblance terminates; for as there is no selection
for entrance into the kingdom of Aides, so there is no
passage onwards from it. We need the less wonder
at the too comprehensive place it occupies, relatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to the places of reward and punishment proper, in the
Homeric scheme, when we remember what a tendency
to develop itself beyond all bounds, the simple primitive
doctrine of the intermediate state has been made
to exhibit, in a portion of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>A further element of indistinctness attaches to the
invisible world of Homer, if we take into view the
admission of favoured mortals to Olympus; a process of
which he gives us instances, as in Ganymedes and
Hercules. In a work of pure invention it is unlikely
that Heaven, Elysium, and the under-world would all
have been represented as receptacles of souls in favour
with the Deity. But some primitive tradition of the
translation of Enoch may account for what would otherwise
stand as an additional anomaly.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the Homeric pictures of the prolongation
of our individual existence beyond the
grave; the continuance in the nether world of the
habits and propensities acquired or confirmed in this;
and the administration in the infernal regions of penalties
for sin; all these things, though vaguely conceived,
stand in marked contrast with the far more
shadowy, impersonal, and, above all, morally neutral
pictures of the invisible and future world, which alone
were admitted into the practical belief of the best among
the Greek philosophers. We are left to presume that the
superior picture owed its superiority to the fact that it
was not of man’s devising, as it thus so far exceeded
what his best efforts could produce.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sacrificial tradition in Homer.</i></div>

<p>The nature, prevalence, and uniformity of sacrifice,
should be regarded as another portion of the primeval
inheritance, which, from various causes, was perhaps
the best preserved of all its parts among nations that
had broken the link of connection with the source.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the sabbatical institution, which the Holy Scripture
appears to fix at the creation of man, we find no
trace in Homer. But it is easy to perceive that this
highly spiritual ordinance was one little likely to survive
the rude shocks and necessities of earthly life, while
it could not, like sacrifice, derive a sustaining force from
appearing to confer upon the gods an absolute gift,
profitable to them, and likely to draw down their
favour in return.</p>

<p>Those who feel inclined to wonder at this disappearance
of the sabbath from the record may do well
to remember, that on the shield of Achilles, which
represents the standing occasions of life in all its
departments, there is no one scene which represents
any observances simply religious. The religious element,
though corrupted, was far from being expelled
out of common life; on the contrary, the whole tissue
of it was pervaded by that element; but it was in a
combined, not in a separate, and therefore not in a
sabbatical form.</p>

<p>And again, in order to appreciate the unlikelihood
that such a tradition as that of the sabbath would long
survive the severance from Divine Revelation in this
wintry world, we have only to consider how rapidly it
is forgotten, in our own time, by Christians in heathen
lands, or by those Christian settlers who are severed
for the time at least from civilization, and whose energies
are absorbed in a ceaseless conflict with the yet
untamed powers of nature.</p>

<i>The inventive Element of the Homeric
Theo-mythology.</i></h2></div>

<p>I come now to that mass of Homeric deities, who
are either wholly mythological, or so loaded with
mythological features, that their traditive character is
depressed, and of secondary importance.</p>

<h3><i>Jupiter.</i></h3>

<p>The character of Jupiter, which commonly occupies
the first place in discussions of the Greek mythology,
has been in some degree forestalled by our prior examination
of the position of other figures in the system,
which are both more interesting and more important,
from their bearing more significant resemblances to
and traces of the truth of Divine Revelation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this character will well repay attention.
To be understood and appreciated, it must be viewed
in a great variety of aspects. When so viewed, it will be
found to range from the sublime down to the brutal, and
almost even down to the ridiculous. Upon the whole,
when we consider that the image which we thus bring
before us was during so many ages, for such multitudes
of the most remarkable portion of mankind, the chief
representative of Godhead, it must leave a deep impression
of pain and melancholy on the mind.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<p>The Jupiter of Homer is to be regarded in these four
distinct capacities:</p>

<p>1. As the depository of the principal remnants of monotheistic
and providential ideas.</p>

<p>2. As the sovereign lord of meteorological phenomena.</p>

<p>3. As the head of the Olympian community.</p>

<p>4. As the receptacle and butt of the principal part
of such earthly, sensual, and appetitive elements, as, at
the time of Homer, anthropophuism had obtruded into
the sphere of deity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Jupiter, as Providence.</i></div>

<p>There are three modes in which Homer connects
Jupiter with the functions of Providence.</p>

<p>1. He procures or presides over the settlement, by
deliberation in the Olympian Court, of great questions
connected with the course of human affairs. In the
Court of the Fourth Iliad, and in the Assembly of the
Eighth, he himself takes the initiative; in the Seventh
and Twentieth Books he listens to the proposals of
Neptune; in the Twenty-fourth, Apollo introduces the
subject; in the First and Fifth Odyssey, Minerva does
the like.</p>

<p>2. He is a kind of synonym for Providence with reference
to its common operations, to the duties and
rights of man, and to the whole order of the world.
Perhaps there are an hundred, or more, passages of the
poems, where he appears in this manner. But they are
all open to this observation, that his name seems, in most
of them, to be used as a mere formula, and to be a sort
of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</i> without the enlivening force of the
idea that he is really acting in the manner or upon the
principle described.</p>

<p>3. On certain occasions, however, he appears as a
supreme God, though single-handed, and not acting
either for or with the Olympian assembly. The grandest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of these occasions is at the close of the Twenty-fourth
Odyssey, where Minerva, stimulated by her own sympathizing
keenness, seems to have winked at the passionate
inclination of Ulysses to make havock among
his ungrateful and rebellious subjects. Jupiter, who
had previously counselled moderation, launches his
thunderbolt, and significantly causes it to fall at the
feet of Minerva, who thereupon gives at once the required
caution to the exasperated sovereign. Peace
immediately follows<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.</p>

<p>Jupiter, with some of the substantial, has all the
titular appendages of a high supremacy. He is habitually
denominated the Father of gods and men. He is
much more frequently identified with the general government
of the world, than is any other deity. He is
universally the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταμίης πολέμοιο</span>. He governs the issue
of all human toil, and gives or withholds success. It is
on his floor that the caskets rest, which contain the
varying, but, in the main, sorrowful incidents of human
destiny<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>. He has also this one marked and paramount
distinction, that he does not descend to earth to execute
his own behests, but in general either sends other deities
as his organs, to give effect to his will, or else
himself operates from afar, by his power as god of air.
If however he is more identified with the general idea
of Providence than are Apollo and Minerva, it is plain,
on the other hand, that his agency is more external,
abstract, and remote; theirs more inward and personal:
especially, the function of moral discipline seems, as we
have already found, to belong to Minerva.</p>

<p>Nägelsbach<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> considers that Jupiter alone can act
from a distance: but the prayer of Glaucus to Apollo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
followed immediately by the healing of his wounds,
seems to prove the reverse conclusively. Again, Minerva
reminds Telemachus that the deity can save even
when at a distance (Od. iii. 231): we have no authority
for absolutely confining this to Jupiter, and
none for affixing a limit to the space within which
Apollo or Minerva can act. That Jupiter always acts
from far, may be due in part to his representing the
tradition of the one God; but the argument is also
in some degree incidental to the nature of his special
and mythological gifts, as god of the atmosphere and
its phenomena.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the marks of affinity to ancient
tradition are stronger in the Homeric Minerva and
Apollo than in Jupiter. He is the ordinary Providence,
but this is an external Providence. He undoubtedly
excels them in force, and in the majesty which accompanies
it. But the highest of the divine prerogatives,
of which we have but glimpses indeed in any of them,
are hung more abundantly around these his favoured
children, than around himself. The secret government
of the minds of men, the invisible supremacy over
natural laws, the power of unravelling the future (except
perhaps as to the destinies of states), the faculty
of controlling death, are scarcely to be discovered in
Jupiter, but are oftener made clearly legible in Apollo
or Minerva. Indeed Minerva appears always to have
latent claims, which Homer himself could not fully understand
or describe, to the very first place. It is only
by supposing the existence of vague traditions to this
effect, that we can explain such passages as that in
which she delights, that Menelaus had prayed to her
in preference to any other deity<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὣς φάτο· γήθησεν δὲ θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη,</div>
       <div class="verse">ὅττι ῥά οἱ πάμπρωτα θεῶν ἠρήσατο πάντων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This sentiment may be accounted for in two ways.
It may be due to the vulgar vanity of a merely mythological
divinity scuffling for precedence. It may be a
remnant of the tradition of a wisdom that knew no
superior. The former cause would be scarcely suitable
even to the deities of invention in Homer. The latter
seems wholly in keeping with the character and position
of his Minerva.</p>

<p>It may be asked, in which of the two capacities does
Jupiter chiefly influence the government of the world?
is it as the Supreme Deity, acting in the main by his
own will and power? or is it as the head of the Olympian
community, to whose deliberate decisions he, in
a species of executive capacity, gives effect?</p>

<p>I think there can be no doubt that the activity of Jupiter
is principally made available in the latter capacity.
Not that the Poet had defined for himself the distinction.
But there were two processes, each of which had
been actively advancing: the breaking up of Godhead
into fragments, which diminished the relative distance
between Jupiter and the other Immortals: and the reflection
of human ideas of polity upon Olympus, which
gave a growing prominence to the element of aristocracy.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, then, I should say that the traditive
ideas of monotheism, and of a personal Providence
represented in the Homeric Jupiter, are on almost all
occasions things of the past. They are like the old
jewels of a family, beautiful and imposing for occasions
of state: but they scarcely enter into his everyday
life. Indeed, their chief effect is the negative one
of withdrawing him, on the score of dignity, from immediate
contact with mortals and with their concerns; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
were it not for his atmospheric prerogatives, this isolated
supremacy would carry him into insignificance
as compared with a deity like Minerva, who is ever
in the view of man, and ever making herself felt both
in his mind and in his affairs.</p>

<p>There are occasions, but they are not very numerous,
when, under the influence of an unwonted zeal, we
find Jupiter himself taking a part in the detailed action
of the Iliad; his interferences being usually confined
to the greater crises or indications, such as the one
mentioned in Il. ii. 353, and such as the occasions when
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάλαντα</span> are produced. As examples of minor interposition,
I may cite his inspiring Ajax with fear, his
launching a thunderbolt in the path of Diomed, his
breaking the bow-string of Teucer, and his advising
Hector to avoid an encounter with Agamemnon<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Jupiter as Lord of Air.</i></div>

<p>But the position assigned to him in the mythology
of Olympus, which provides him with the second of his
characters, is chosen with great skill. Although at first
sight Sea may appear a more substantive and awful
power than Air, and Earth a more solid and worthy
foundation of dominion than either, yet consideration
must readily show, that as the king of the atmosphere,
Jupiter is possessed of far more prompt, effective, and
above all, universal means of acting upon mankind, than
he would have been had the lottery been so arranged
as to give him either of those other provinces.</p>

<p>The tradition of a Trinity in the Godhead evidently
leaves its traces on the Greek mythology in the curious
fable of the three Kronid brothers. For the lottery of
the universe, in which they draw on equal terms, is
not founded upon, but is at variance with, Greek ideas.
Those ideas embodied the system, more or less defined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of primogeniture: and therefore, had the Olympian
system been wholly inventive, the very least it could
have assigned to Jupiter would have been a priority of
choice among the different portions of the universe.
This lottery is evidently founded upon the idea of an
essential equality in those who draw. Happily the
result is such as to coincide with the order of natural
precedence: and the value and weight of the three
charges is graduated according to the standing of the
brothers, though their abstract equality is so rigidly
asserted by Neptune, who declares himself <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰσόμορον
καὶ ὁμῇ πεπρωμένον αἴσῃ</span> (Il. xv. 209).</p>

<p>The exclusion of Earth from the lottery is singular:
but it appears to have a double justification. In the first
place, we must bear in mind the regularity of its operations,
combined with the fact that it sensibly acts on nothing,
but is passive under other agencies, such as those
of Sun, Wind, and Sea. This would have rendered the
conception of it as a deity comparatively feeble in the
Greek mind. In the second place, it is probable that
when the Olympian mythology took its shape, that
province was preoccupied: that the Eastern religions,
observing its jointly passive and productive character,
had personified it as feminine. But even this did not
content the Greek imagination. The conception of
the bride of the chief deity was disengaged from brute
matter, and uplifted into a divinity having for its office
the care and government of a civilized and associated
people. The Homeric Juno may almost be defined as
the goddess of Greece. There rose up in her place,
like a low mist of evening, from the ground, the comparatively
obscure Homeric <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γαῖα</span>, who has no life or
function, except in connection with the idea of vengeance
to be executed upon the wicked; and this she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
probably derives from the belief, that the rebel spirits
were punished in the subterranean prisons, of which she
was as it were, by physical laws, the necessary keeper.</p>

<p>As Lord of the air, Jupiter came to be endowed with
a multitude of active powers the most palpable, and the
most replete with at least outward influence for man.
The years are his years, the thunder and lightning his
thunder and lightning, the rain his rain; the rivers, or
the most illustrious among them, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διϊπετεῖς ποταμοὶ</span>,
are his: the clouds and tempests obey his compelling,
the winds blow at his command. The hail and snow
come from him<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>: he impels the falling star<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>, and, when
he desires a more effective weapon or a more solemn
lesson than usual, he launches the scathing thunderbolt<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.
All signs and portents whatever, that appear in
air, belong primarily to him; as does the genial sign
of the rainbow,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent22">ἅστε Κρονίων</div>
       <div class="verse">ἐν νέφεϊ στήριξε, τέρας μερόπων ἀνθρώπων<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And when these or any of them are used by other
deities, it is only by such as have a peculiar relationship,
either traditive or mythological, to him.</p>

<p>But as the tradition of the lottery adorns and
strengthens, so in another view it circumscribes him.
His sway is unknown in the regions of the dead, where
his brother holds the sceptre, as the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς καταχθόνιος</span><a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>.
Accordingly, when Hercules is sent to fetch Cerberus,
Jupiter obtains for him the aid of Minerva. The more
traditive deity escapes the circumscriptions of the less;
the daughter eclipses the sire.</p>

<p>Much of the higher power exerted by Juno is in fact
her use of the atmospheric prerogatives of her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>Jupiter as Head of Olympus.</i></div>

<p>But the most considerable and characteristic manifestation
of the Homeric Jupiter is that, in which he
appears as Head of the Olympian Family and Polity.
Of this let us now consider so much, as is not more
immediately connected with the subject of the divine
Polity.</p>

<p>He is carefully marked out as supreme in the mythological
prerogatives, which are for Olympus as the
Crown and Sword of State on Earth. He is the original
owner of the Ægis. To him the gods rise up at
their meetings<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. He is not tied to swear by Styx<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>,
and invokes no infernal power to be the sanction of his
word, but condescends only to use the symbol of a nod.</p>

<p>Of omnipotence, as we understand the word, it would
not appear that Homer had any idea. He had however
the idea of a being superior in force to all other gods
separately, or perhaps even when combined. This being
was Jupiter. But the conception in his mind was a
wavering one, so that, though it was present to him, we
cannot say that he embraced it as a truth. If by some
parts of the poems it is supported, by others it is brought
into question or overthrown. As respects Briareus,
who was not a god, his superiority in mere force to Jupiter
is expressly declared (Il. i. 404).</p>

<p>In the Assembly of the Eighth Book, Jupiter loudly
proclaims his personal superiority in strength to all the
other gods and goddesses combined; and boasts that,
while by a golden chain they could not unitedly drag
him down to earth, he could drag them all, with earth
and sea to boot behind them.</p>

<p>Again, when in the same Book Juno<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> suggests to
Neptune the plan of a combination among all the
Hellenizing gods to restrain Jupiter, and to assist the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Greeks in despite of him, Neptune replies that he at
least will have nothing to say to such a proceeding, for
Jupiter is far too strong<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>.</p>

<p>But in the First Book we learn that a rebellion
headed by Juno, Neptune, and Minerva, was too much
for him. It is, however, clear that he had not actually
been put in chains by these deities; but they were about
to do it, when Briareus came to the rescue, and by his
mere appearance reestablished Jupiter in secure supremacy.
This legend has a mark of antiquity in the fact
that Briareus has two names; he is known as Briareus
among the gods, and as Ægæon among all mankind<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>.</p>

<p>When, in the Fifteenth Book, Jupiter apprehends a
stubborn resistance from Neptune, and the necessity of
his personally undertaking the execution of his own
commands, he is far from easy. With the aid of Juno,
his brother can, he thinks, easily be managed<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>. When
he finds Neptune has retired, he frankly owns it is
much better for them both; as to have put him down
by force<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> would have been a tough business (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὔ κεν ἀνιδρωτί
γ’ ἐτελέσθη</span>).</p>

<p>Juno and Minerva, single or combined, he threatens
freely, and the first of these he had once severely
punished: but Neptune was stronger, though in mind
inferior; and we have no direct evidence that he was
present in the Assembly of the Eighth Book, when Jupiter
bragged of his being stronger than them all together.
Neither he nor Juno obeyed the command of
Jupiter, to observe neutrality until his purpose of glorifying
Hector should have been accomplished.</p>

<p>On the whole, the superiority of Jupiter to any one
god is clear, though not immeasurable. His superiority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to the whole is doubtful. The point in his favour is,
that he never was actually coerced. The point against
him is, that his will seems to give place, and this too
on very great occasions, to the sentiments of the weightiest
part of the Olympian Court.</p>

<p>In his government of the other gods, the moral element
disappears. He does not appeal to their sense
of right, nor profess to be ruled in his own proceedings
towards them by impartial justice. On the contrary,
he desires the wounded Mars not to sit whining by his
side; and, before ordering Paieon to heal his hurts,
makes a distinct declaration, that had he been the son
of any deity other than himself, he should have been
ejected from heaven into a lower place, apparently
meaning the dark and dismal Tartarus, on account of
his love of quarrels. A profound attachment to ease
and self-enjoyment lies at the root of his character.
He never disturbs the established order; and he is averse
to movement and innovation, come from whence it
may. The spirit of Juno<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>, so restless on behalf of
Greece, is vexatious to him in the highest degree: and
his love of Troy, if it has reference to any thing beyond
liberality in sacrifices and the descent of Dardanus, may
perhaps be referred to its representing the stereotyped
form of society. It is probably on account of this indolence
of temperament that, when he has brought
Hector and the Trojans as far as the Ships, he feels
he has had enough for the moment of the spectacle of
blood; and accordingly he turns his eyes over Thrace
and the country of the Mysians, the Hippemolgians,

in a change of prospect; but at another time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
refreshed as we may suppose, he coolly states that he
shall enjoy a sight of the battle:</p>

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His political spirit.</i></div>

<p>The political element of Jupiter’s character, reflected
more narrowly and turbulently in Juno, is, however,
that which deserves the greatest attention.</p>

<p>It was so deeply implanted in him, that it entered
into his personal conduct even when he was not in immediate
contact with the Olympian body. For example,
in the Sixteenth Iliad, Jupiter debates with
himself whether he shall save Sarpedon from death by
the hand of Patroclus. Juno, to whom he had made
a sort of appeal for approval, protests according to the
Olympian formula,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἔρδ’· ἀτὰρ οὔ τοι πάντες ἐπαινέομεν θεοὶ ἄλλοι.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She suggests in preference a prompt rescue and disposal
of the dead body. Jupiter is not here in actual contact
with any one but Juno. She, however, menaces
him with the spleen of the Immortals, and he, averse
to trouble, and fearful of shaking his own seat, acquiesces,
though at the cost of the utmost pain<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.</p>

<p>Over and above the mere insignia of sovereignty,
Jupiter holds some of his best prerogatives, both terrestrial
and Olympian, in the capacity of head of the
community of Immortals.</p>

<p>Hence it is that he is the steward of sovereignty,
and the champion of social rights. All princes and
rulers hold from him, and administer justice under his
authority. He gave their sceptre to the family of Pelops:
even the heralds are his agents, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διὸς ἄγγελοι</span>, and
act in his name.</p>

<p>On Olympus it falls to him in this capacity, not
only to conduct and superintend the proceedings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
whole body of Immortals, as a body, but to exercise a
very large influence over their relations individually
with men, and with one another. The Sun carries to
Jupiter in full court, as head of the body, his complaint
against the crew of Ulysses, and Jupiter at once undertakes
to avenge it<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>. Juno, again, appeals to him on
the conduct of Mars<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>, and he permits her to let loose
Minerva on him. Mars, when wounded, goes to Jupiter
with his complaint<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>, and Diana also, when requested,
makes him privy to hers, after she has taken
her seat upon his knee<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>. When any two deities are in
any manner at issue or in collision, or when any of the
more dependent gods have a quarrel with men, then
Jupiter finds his place as the natural arbiter, and from
this source he obtains great support for his power.
The surest of all its guarantees is indeed found in the
skill with which, by making the will of Olympus his
own, he makes his own will irresistible.</p>

<p>Thus then the Jupiter of Homer has varied elements
of grandeur, traditional, physical, and political. Something
also accrues to him by the sheer necessity of the
metaphysical order. Wherever the mind demands a
personal origin or cause, he alone can offer to supply
its want. He still continues to represent, in a certain
degree, the principle of unity; and he derives strength
from that principle. Nor does the solid might of Destiny
interfere with his claims to the same extent in
Homer, as it does in the later Greek poetry.</p>

<p>Thus equipped with august prerogatives, the Jupiter
of Homer is evidently, to the popular view, the most
sublime object in the Olympian mythology. His breadth
and grandeur of dimension commended him to the ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>miring
favour of the Greek artist, who made it his
supreme effort to embody the conception of the Sovereign
of Olympus: and we may judge of his elevation
in the public apprehension over all other deities, by the
greater sublimity of the material forms, in which the
idea of his divinity has been enshrined.</p>

<p>But the figure of Jupiter, as it is the principal, so it
is also the most anomalous, in the whole Homeric assemblage.
Although he is, and even because he is, the
depository of so many among the most primitive and
venerable ideas, he becomes also the butt alike of the
infirmity, and the wantonness, and insolence of human
thought, in the alterative operations which it continually
prosecutes upon the ancient and pure idea of Godhead.
Hence not only in his character, as in other
cases, does the inventive power everywhere sap, corrode,
invade, and curtail the ancient traditionary conception
of divine truths, but it is in him that we find
both systems culminating at once, both exhibiting in
him, raised to the highest power, their separate and
discordant characteristics.</p>

<p>From one point of view Jupiter is the most sublime
of all the deities of Homer, because he is the first personal
source and origin of life, the father of gods and
men, the supreme manifestation of Power and knowledge,
the principal, though imperfect living representation
of a Providence and Governor of the world.</p>

<p>Regarded from another point of view, as we see disclosed
the large intrusion of the human and carnal
element into the ethereal sphere, the character of
Jupiter becomes the most repulsive in the whole circle
of Olympian life<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>. The emancipation from truth, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
self-abandonment to gross passion, the constant breach
of the laws he administers, are more conspicuous in the
chief god than in any of the subordinate gods, and are
more offensive in proportion to the majesty with which
they are unnaturally associated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Jupiter as the type of animalism.</i></div>

<p>The ungovernable self-indulgence, which even so
early as in the time of Homer has begun to taint
through and through the whole human conception of
the Immortals, rises to its climax, as was to be expected,
in Jupiter. The idea of the Supreme, or at
least by far the First being of the universe, had not
yet, indeed, descended so low as it did in after-times,
when it was even associated with lusts contrary to
nature. Of these there is no trace in Homer. But the
law which governs the relation of sex, as it exists among
men, was utterly relaxed and disorganized for him. In
the first place, monogamy, established for all Greeks, for
the chief god of Greece became polygamy; and in the
second, marriage was no bar against incessant adultery.</p>

<p>A certain distinction between the wives, and the
mere paramours, of Jupiter is clearly traceable in Homer.
Latona, for instance, is a wife, an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλοχος</span> of
Jupiter. Mercury says of <span class="lock">her<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent24">ἀργαλέον δὲ</div>
       <div class="verse">πληκτίζεσθ’ ἀλόχοισι Διὸς νεφεληγερέταο.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the intrigues with the wife of Ixion, or with the
daughter of Phœnix, who bore to him the great Minos,
mark mere adultery, and involve no kind of permanent
relation between Jupiter and this class of the mothers
of his children. Hence we do not find any such person
possessed of an interest in him, like that which led him
to take part in the vengeance inflicted on Niobe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
her family by the children of Latona<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>. Again, as he is
not a personal providence, and does not take charge of
the destiny or guide the conduct of individuals, nor
ever touches the depths of human nature, so he has at
once the largest share of the passions and the smallest
stock of the sympathies of man.</p>

<p>From an intermediate point between the grandeur
and the vileness of Jupiter, we may observe how unequal
the human mind had already proved to sustain
its own idea. He ought to be supreme in knowledge;
but he is thrice deluded by the cunning of Juno<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>, who
not only outwits him, but sends Iris down to earth
without his knowledge, just as Neptune moves (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λάθρη</span>)
on the plain of Troy unseen by him<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>. He ought to be
supreme in force, and he boasts that he could drag
with ease all the deities of Olympus, whom he addressed,
but he is, notwithstanding, on the point of
being overpowered by a combination of inferior deities,
when he is saved by the timely arrival of Briareus
with the hundred hands. His faculty of vision does
not seem to be limited by space when he chooses to
employ it<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>, but it is subject to interruption, both voluntary
and involuntary, from sleep<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>.</p>

<p>Although there is great scenic grandeur in the part
which he plays in the Iliad, in the Odyssey he is until
nearly the close practically a mute, and does little more
than assent to the plans and representations of Minerva.</p>

<p>In the action, however, of the Iliad, the only glimpse
of a personal attachment is to Hector; and this is
founded simply on the abundance of his sacrifices.
Jupiter is the great propounder of the animal view of
that subject: and accordingly in the Odyssey<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>, Minerva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
pleads the case of Ulysses very much on this ground
before Jupiter, though, in all her intercourse with that
chief, there is no sign of her valuing the offerings on
her own account. In every point of sensual susceptibility,
Jupiter leads the way for the Immortals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Qualified by his parental instincts.</i></div>

<p>In Jupiter, as in the almost brutal Mars, we find
remaining that relic of personal virtue which depends
least upon reflection, and flows most from instinct,
namely, parental affection. Mars is wrought up to
fury by learning the death of his son Ascalaphus; and
Jupiter, after much painful rumination on consenting
to the fall of Sarpedon, sheds gouts of blood over the
dearest of his children<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>. This is singularly grand as
poetry, and far superior to the sheer mania of Mars.
Indeed it is evident that Homer exerted himself to the
utmost in adorning this majestic figure, as a mere figure,
with the richest treasures of his imagination.</p>

<p>When, in the Twenty-First Iliad, the great battle of
the gods begins, Jupiter has no part to take. He sits
aloft in his independent security, while they contend
together, even as he was afterwards supposed to keep
aloof from trouble and responsibility for human affairs.
The same sentiment appears in the determination of
Neptune and Apollo not to quarrel on account of
mortals. But in the case of Jupiter, the selfish principle
comes out with greater force: he is not merely
indifferent, but he absolutely rejoices in the strife of
the Immortals:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent14">ἐγέλασσε δέ οἱ φίλον ἦτορ</div>
       <div class="verse">γηθοσύνῃ, ὅθ’ ὁρᾶτο θεοὺς ἔριδι ξυνιόντας.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Upon the whole it is certainly the Jupiter of Homer
in whom, of all his greater gods, notwithstanding his
abstract attributes, we see, first, the most complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
surrender of personal morality and self-government to
mere appetite; secondly, the most thoroughly selfish
groundwork of character: the germ, and in no small
degree the development, of what was afterwards to
afford to speculation the materials for the Epicurean
theory respecting the divine nature, as it is set forth
in the verse of Lucretius, or in the arguments of the
Ciceronian Cotta.</p>

<h3><i><a id="Juno"></a>Juno.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Juno of Homer.</i></div>

<p>The Juno of the Iliad is by far the most conspicuous
and splendid, as she is also the most evidently national,
product of the inventive power to be found in the entire
circle of the theo-mythology.</p>

<p>Not that Greek invention created her out of nothing.
On the contrary, she represented abundant prototypes
in the mythologies of the East. Her Greek name, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἥρη</span>,
is, I apprehend, a form of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔρα</span>, the earth<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>; and in her
first form she probably represented one of its oriental
impersonations. But they all had to pass through the
crucible, and they came out in a form as purely Hellenic
as if it had been absolutely original.</p>

<p>It is plain from the nature of the case, that she can
have had no place in primitive tradition. But it may
be well before discussing her mythological origin, her
dignity and positive functions, to refer to certain indications
from which we may make sure that Homer has
handled the character in the mode observed by him
for deities of invention only.</p>

<p>There is, then, about Juno a liability to passion, and
a want of moral elevation, which are among the certain
marks of mythological origin. Jupiter declares his
belief that, if she could, she would eat the Trojans; nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
does she resent the imputation<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>. When Vulcan is
born, angry at the mean appearance and lameness of
the infant, she pitches him down into the sea<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>. These
representations are entirely at variance with the constant
dignity and self-command, which mark the deportment
of the great traditive deities. Her whole
activity in the Iliad is not merely energetic, but in the
highest degree passionate and ardent.</p>

<p>So again, taking into consideration the comparative
purity attaching to her sex, which we see so fully maintained
in Diana, her resort to the use of sensual passion,
in Il. xiv., even though only as an instrument for an
end, is a mark that the character is, in its basis, mythological.</p>

<p>Nor do we anywhere find ascribed to her ethical, or
what may be called theistic sentiments: pure power
and policy are her delight; and she nowhere enters
individually within the line of the moral and Providential
order at all, nor takes any share in superintending
it<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Iliad, of which the martial movement is
appropriate to her, and where the Greek nationality is
placed in sharp contrast with a foreign one, she plays
a great part, is ever alert and at work, and contributes
mainly to the progress of the action. But in the
Odyssey, a poem more simply theistic and ethical, and
without any opposition of nationalities, she has no
share in the action, and may be said practically to disappear
from view. To appreciate the force of this
circumstance, we must contrast it with Homer’s treatment
of another deity, inferior to her in the Olympian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
community. The three greatest deities, among those
who embody much of primitive tradition, are Jupiter,
Minerva, and Apollo. Of these, Jupiter, in the character
of Providence, has everywhere a place ready
made for him; Minerva, as the guide and protectress
of Ulysses, has ample opportunities for her activity;
but it is not so with Apollo: and in consequence
Homer has been careful to supply in the poem points
of contact with him, by the introduction of Theoclymenus,
and of the grand imagery of the second sight,
which is his gift; by fixing the critical day at the
new moon, which was sacred to him, and by causing
the crisis to turn upon the bow, his famous weapon: as
though these three, Jupiter, Minerva, and Apollo, were
the universal, permanent, and indispensable deities;
but the others occasional, and to be used according to
circumstances. Juno has no such place or office provided
for her in the Odyssey, as they have.</p>

<p>There is yet another mark adhering to Juno, which
clearly separates between her and the Homeric deities
of strongly marked traditional character: namely, that
she was not exempt from the touch of defeat and dishonour.
For, in the course of her long feud with
Hercules, that hero wounded her with an arrow in the
left breast, and caused her to suffer desperate pain<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>.
Again, she was ignominiously punished by Jupiter;
who suspended her with her hands in chains, and with
anvils hanging from her feet<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her intense nationality.</i></div>

<p>Her strong and profound Greek nationality has
obtained for her the name of Argeian Juno. The fervour
of this nationality is most signally exemplified in
the passage where Jupiter tells her, that she regards
the Greeks as her children<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>; and again, where she lets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
us know that it was she<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> who collected the armament
against Troy. She conducts Agamemnon the head of
the Greek nation safely on the sea<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>; and carries Jason
through the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πλαγκταί</span><a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>. This is the vivifying idea of her
whole character, and fills it with energy, vigilance, determination,
and perseverance. Her hatred of Hercules
cannot have been owing to conjugal jealousy,
with which she is not troubled in Homer, for Jupiter
recites his conquests in addressing her on Ida; indeed,
had she been liable to this emotion, it must, from the
frequent recurrence of its occasions, have supplied the
main thread of her feeling and action. It was her
identification in soul with the Perseid dynasty, the legitimate
representative, in its own day, of the Hellenic
race, and in occupation of its sovereign seat, that made
her filch, on behalf of Eurystheus, the effect of the promise
intended by Jupiter for Hercules, and that engaged
her afterwards in a constant struggle to bear down that
elastic hero, whose high personal gifts still threatened
to eclipse his royal relative and competitor. So again,
unlike Minerva<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>, even while seeking to operate through
Trojans, she studiously avoids contact with them. Minerva
is sent as agent to Pandarus<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>; but this is on
the suggestion of Juno. In truth, this intensely national
stamp localizes the divinity of Juno, and, being counteracted
by no other sign, fixes on her the note both of
invention, and of Greek invention.</p>

<p>With respect now to her dignity and positive functions,
these are of a very high order.</p>

<p>The Olympian gods rise from their seats to greet her
(as they do to Jupiter) when she comes among them<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>She acts immediately upon the thoughts of men:
as when, at the outset of the Iliad, she prompts Achilles
to call the first Greek assembly; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τῷ γὰρ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε
θεὰ λευκώλενος Ἥρη</span><a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>. On various occasions, she suggests
action to Minerva, and it follows<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>: in the First
Book, Juno is even said to send her, though by another
arrangement the Poet has provided against attaching
inferiority to that goddess<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>. It may be that in her
seeming to employ Minerva, as in so many of her highest
functions, she is reflecting one of the high prerogatives
of Jupiter. Certain it is that by the side of her
ceaseless and passionate activity, even Minerva appears,
except on the battle-field, to play, in the Iliad, a part
secondary to hers. She was so powerful<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>, not only as
to form one of the great trine rebellion against Jupiter,
which so nearly dethroned him, but as to make him
feel greatly relieved and rejoiced, in his differences
with Neptune, when she promises to side with him<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>:
‘with your aid,’ so thinks Jupiter, ‘he will easily be
kept in order, and will have to act as <i>we</i> could wish.’
She is certainly the most bold, untiring, zealous, and
effective assistant to the Greeks: while she never
bates a hair of her wrath, in compassion or otherwise,
towards any Trojan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her mythological functions.</i></div>

<p>Like Neptune and others, she assumes the human
form<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>, and evokes a cloud of vapour this way or that:
but she does much more. Her power displays itself in
various forms, both over deities, and over animate and
inanimate nature. In some of these particularly, her
proceedings seem to be a reflected image of her hus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>band’s.
Iris<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> is not only his messenger, but her’s.
She not only orders the Winds, but she sends the Sun
to his setting<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>, in spite of his reluctance. When, in
her indignation at the boast of Hector, she rocks on
her throne, she shakes Olympus<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>. She endows the
deathless horses of Achilles with a voice<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>. And conjoined
with Minerva, she thunders in honour of Agamemnon
when just armed. Except the case of the
horse, all these appear to be the reflected uses of the
power of Jupiter as god of air.</p>

<p>We find from the speech of Phœnix, that with
Minerva she can confer valour<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>. In a curious passage
of the Odyssey, Homer tells us how the daughters of
Pandarus were supplied by various goddesses with
various qualities and gifts. Diana gave them size,
Juno gave them <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἶδος καὶ πινυτήν</span>. We should rather
have expected the last to come from Minerva: but
she endowed them with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔργα</span> or industrial skill, so
that her dignity has been in another way provided for.
But if the lines are genuine, then in the capacity of
Juno to confer the gift of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πινυτὴ</span> or prudence, we see a
point of contact between her powerful but more limited,
and Minerva’s larger character<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>.</p>

<p>The full idea of her mind is in fact contained in the
union of great astuteness with her self-command, force,
and courage: which, in effect, makes it the reflection
of the genius of the Greeks when deprived of its
moral element: and places it in very near correspondence
with that of the Phœnicians, who are like
Greeks, somewhat seriously maimed in that one great
department. This full idea is exhibited on two great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
occasions. Once when she outwits Jupiter, by fastening
him with an oath to his promise, and then, hastening
one birth, and by her command over the Eilithuiæ retarding
another, proceeds to make Eurystheus the recipient
of what Jupiter had intended for another less remote
descendant of his own. Again, in the Fourteenth
Iliad, by a daring combination, she hoaxes Venus to
obtain her capital charm, induces Sleep by a bribe to
undertake an almost desperate enterprise, and then,
though on account of his sentiments towards Troy
she felt disgust (Il. xiv. 158) as she looked upon Jupiter,
enslaves him for the time through a passion of which
she is not herself the slave, but which she uses as her
instrument for a great end of policy. She is, in short,
a great, fervid, unscrupulous, and most able Greek patriot,
exhibiting little of divine ingredients, but gifted
with a marked and powerful human individuality.</p>

<p>It may be worth while to observe in passing, an
indication as to the limited powers of locomotion
which Homer ascribed to his deities. The horses
of Juno, when she drives, cover at each step a space
as great as the human eye can command looking
along the sea. But when she has the two operations
to perform on the same day, one upon the mother of
Eurystheus, and the other on the mother of Hercules,
she attends to the first in her own person, and apparently
manages the other by command given to the
Eilithuiæ (Il. xix. 119). If so, then she was evidently
in the Poet’s mind subject to the laws of space and
corporal presence: and his figure of the horse’s spring
was one on which he would not rely for the management
of an important piece of business.</p>

<p>There are three places, and three only, in the poems,
which could connect Juno with the Trojans. One is the
Judgment of Paris (Il. xxiv. 29). The others are no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
than verbal only. Hector swears by Jupiter “the loud
thundering husband of Here<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>.” And again, he wishes he
had as certainly Jupiter for his father, and Juno for his
mother<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>, as he is certain that the day will bring disaster
to the Greeks. We cannot, then, say that she was absolutely
unknown to the Trojans in her Hellenic form,
while they may have been more familiar with her eastern
prototypes<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>. It does not, however, follow, that she
was a deity of established worship among them. There
is no notice of any institution or act of religion on
the one side, or of care on the other, between her and
any member of their race. In the mention of her
among the Trojans, we may perhaps have an instance
of the very common tendency of the heathen nations
to adopt, by sympathy as it were, deities from one
another; independently of all positive causes, such as
migration, or ethnical or political connection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her mythological origin.</i></div>

<p>The origin of Juno, which would thus on many
grounds appear to have been Hellenic, appears to be
referable to the principle, which I have called œconomy,
and under which the relations of deities were thrown
into the known forms of the human family. This
process, according to the symmetrical and logical turn
of the Greek mind, began when it was needed for
its purpose, and stopped when it had done its work.
Gods, that were to generate or rear other gods, were
coupled; and partners were supplied by simple reflection
of the character of the male, where there was no Idea or
Power ready for impersonation that would serve the
turn. Thus, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ῥέα</span>, Earth or Matter, found a suitable
mate for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>, or Time. But to make a match for
Oceanus, his own mere reflected image, or feminine, was
called into being under the name of Tethys. Such was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
but only after the time of Homer, Amphitrite for Neptune,
and Proserpine for Hades. In Homer the latter
is more, and the former less than this. It was by nothing
less than an entire metamorphosis, that the Greek
Juno was educed from, or substituted for, some old deification
of the Earth. She is much more a creation
than an adaptation. What she really represents in
Olympus, is supernatural wifehood; of which the common
mark is, the want of positive and distinct attributes
in the goddess. With this may be combined a
negative sign not less pregnant with evidence; namely,
the derivation and secondary handling of the prerogatives
of the husband. The case of Juno is clear and
strong under both heads. Her grandeur arises from
her being clothed in the reflected rays of her husband’s
supremacy, like Achilles in the flash of the Ægis. But
positive divine function she has none whatever, except
the slender one of presiding over maternity by her
own agency, and by that of her figurative daughters,
the Eilithuiæ. She is, when we contemplate her
critically, the goddess of motherhood and of nothing
else. And in truth, as the fire made Vulcan, and war
made Mars, her mythological children, so motherhood
made Juno, and is her type in actual nature. She became
a goddess, to give effect to the principle of œconomy,
to bring the children of Jupiter into the world,
to enable man, in short, to construct that Olympian
order, which he was to worship. Having been thus
conceived, she assumed high powers and dignities in
right of her husband, whose sister she was fabled to be,
upon becoming also his wife, because either logical instinct,
or the ancient traditions of our race rendered it
a necessity for the Greeks to derive the divine, as well
as the human, family from a single pair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>However strictly Hellenic may have been the position
of Juno, we must reckon her as the sister of Jupiter
to have been worshipped, in Homer’s time, from beyond
the memory of man. For she carries upon her no
token, which can entitle us to assign to her a recent
origin. Recent, I mean, in her Hellenic form: apart
from the fact that she was not conceived by the
Greeks, so to speak, out of nothing; and that she, in
common with many other deities, represents the Greek
remodelling, in this case peculiarly searching and complete,
of eastern traditions. The representation in theology
of the female principle was eastern, and, as we
have seen, even Jewish. Had Juno been simply adopted,
she would probably have been an elemental power, corresponding
with Earth in the visible creation. In lieu
of this she became Queen of Olympus, and, in relation
to men, goddess of Greece. Earth remains, in Homer,
almost unvivified in consequence. But it may have
been on account of this affinity, as well as of her relation
to Jupiter, that she has been so liberally endowed
with power over nature.</p>

<h3><i>Neptune.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Neptune of Homer.</i></div>

<p>Neptune is one of three sons of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ῥέα</span>, and
comes next to Jupiter in order of birth. In the
Fifteenth Iliad he claims an equality of rank, and avers
that the distribution of sovereignties among the three
brothers was made by lot. The Sea is his, the Shades
are subject to Aides, Jupiter has the Heaven and Air;
Earth and Olympus are common to them all. Wherefore,
says Neptune, I am no mere satellite of Jupiter:
great as he is, let him rest content with his own share;
and if he wants somebody to command, let him command
his own sons and daughters. Perhaps there may
here be conveyed a taunt at Jupiter with respect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the independent and adverse policy of Minerva. This
very curious speech is delivered by Neptune in reply to
the command of Jupiter, that he should leave the field
of battle before Troy, which was backed by threats.
Iris, the messenger, who hears him, in her reply founds
the superiority of Jupiter on his seniority only. To
this Neptune yields: but reserves his right of resentment
if Jupiter should spare Troy<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>. Nor does Jupiter
send down Apollo to encourage the Trojans, until
Neptune has actually retired: he then expresses great
satisfaction at the withdrawal of Neptune without a
battle between them, which would have been heard
and felt in Tartarus; possibly implying that Neptune
would have been hurled into it<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>, but referring distinctly
to the certain difficulty of the affair;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἐπεὶ οὔ κεν ἀνιδρωτί γ’ ἐτελέσθη<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We have now clearly enough before us the very
singular combination of ideas that entered into the
conception of the Homeric Neptune, and we may pronounce,
with tolerable confidence, upon the manner in
which each one of them acquired its place there. They
are these:</p>

<p>1. As one of the trine brotherhood, who are jointly
possessed of the highest power over the regions of
creation, he is part-representative of the primeval tradition
respecting the Divine Nature and Persons.</p>

<p>2. As god of the Sea, he provides an impersonation
to take charge of one of the great domains of external
nature.</p>

<p>3. As the eldest and strongest, next to Jupiter, of
the Immortal family, he represents the nucleus of
rivalry and material, or main-force, opposition to the
head of the Olympian family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>His traits chiefly mythological.</i></div>

<p>With respect to the first, the proposition itself seems
to contain nearly all that can be said to belong to Neptune
in right of primitive tradition, except indeed as to
certain stray relics. One of these seems to hang about
him, in the form of an extraordinary respect paid to
him by the children of Jupiter. Apollo is restrained by
this feeling (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span>) from coming to blows with him<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>: a
similar sentiment restrains Minerva, not only from appearing
to Ulysses in her own Phæacian <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλσος</span><a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>, but even,
as she says, from assisting him at all during his previous
adventures<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. But this is all. The prerogatives which
are so conspicuous in Apollo and Minerva, and which
establish their origin as something set higher than the
lust of pure human invention, are but rarely and slightly
discernible in Neptune. In simple strength he stands
with Homer next to Jupiter, for to no other deity
would Jupiter have paid the compliment of declaring it
a serious matter to coerce him. But there is no sign
of intellectual or moral elevation about him. Of the
former we may judge from his speeches; for the
speeches of gods are in Homer nearly as characteristic
as those of heroes. As to the latter, his numerous
human children show that he did not rise above the
mythological standard; and his implacable resentment
against Ulysses was occasioned by a retribution that
the monster Polyphemus had received, not only just in
itself, but even relatively slight.</p>

<p>It does not appear that prayer is addressed to him
except in connection with particular places, or in virtue
of special titles; as when the Neleids, his descendants,
offer sacrifice to him on the Pylian shore<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>, or the Phæacians<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
seek to avert threatened disaster, or when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Polyphemus his son roars to him for help<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>. The
sacrifices to him have apparently a local character: at
Onchestus is his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλσος</span><a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>, and Juno appeals to him in
the name of the offerings made to him by the Greeks
at Helice and Ægæ<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>. The Envoys of the Ninth Iliad
pray to him for the success of their enterprise; but it
is while their mission is leading them along the sea-beach<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>.
He can assume the form of a man; can carry
off his friends in vapour, or lift them through the air<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>;
can inspire fire and vigour into heroes, yet this is done
only through a sensible medium, namely, by a stroke of
his staff<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>. He blunts, too, the point of an hostile spear<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>.
But none of these operations are of the highest order
of power. And when Polyphemus faintly expresses
the idea that Neptune can restore his eye, (which
however he does not ask in prayer,) Ulysses taunts
him in reply with it as an undoubted certainty, that
the god can do no such thing. With this we may contrast
the remarkable bodily changes operated by Minerva
upon Ulysses: they do not indeed involve the
precise point of restoring a destroyed member; but
they are far beyond anything which Homer has ascribed
to his Neptune. Nor does the Poet ever speak of any
operation of this kind as exceeding the power of Minerva;
who enjoyed in a larger form, and by a general
title, something like that power of transformation,
which was the special gift and function of Circe and
the Sirens. The discussion of the prerogatives of that
half-sorceress, half-goddess, will throw some further
light upon the rank of Neptune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Except, then, in his position as brother and copartner,
Neptune is very feebly marked with the traditional
character. Again, in no deity is the mere animal delight
in sacrifice more strongly developed. By offerings,
his menaced destruction of the Phæacian city
seems to be averted. His pleasure in the sacrifice of
bulls is specially recorded<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>: and his remarkable fondness
for the Solyman mountains, and the Ethiopian
quarter, is perhaps connected with the eminent liberality
of that people at their altars.</p>

<p>One traditive note, however, we find upon him, when
we regard him as god of the sea: and it is this, that
he is provided with a Secondary. It seems as though
it was felt, that he did not wholly satisfy the demands
of the mere element: and accordingly a god simply
elemental has been provided in the person of Nereus,
who is the centre of the submarine court, and who appears
never to quit the depths. Nereus is the element
impersonated: Neptune is its sovereign, has not his
origin in it, but comes to it from without.</p>

<p>Neither is his command over the waters quite exclusive.
He can of course raise a storm at sea. He
can break off fragments, as the sea does, from rocks
upon the coast<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>: and he threatens to overwhelm the
Phæacian city by this means<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>. In conjunction with
his power over the sea, he can let loose the winds, and
darken the sky. On the other hand, not Jupiter only,
but Juno and Minerva, can use the sea independently
of him, as an instrument of their designs.</p>

<p>Again, while not fully developed as the mere elemental
sea-god, he has clinging to him certain traditions
which it is very difficult to attach to any portion
whatever of his general character. I do not find any
key to his interest in Æneas, whom he rescues from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Achilles: unless it may possibly be, that the gods, in
the absence of any particular motive the other way,
took a common interest in the descendants of their race,
or of Jupiter as its head. Still less is it feasible to explain
the legend of his service under Laomedon in company
with Apollo, so as to place it in any clear relation
to the other traditions respecting him. He has, again, a
peculiar relation to the horse, for though a sea-god, he
employs the animal to transport him to Troas; and it
was he, who presented Xanthus and Balius to Peleus<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>.
Again, he, in conjunction with Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>, conferred the
gift of managing the horse on his descendant Antilochus.</p>

<p>In the legend of the Eighth Odyssey, he does not
share the unbecoming laughter of the other deities at
the ridiculous predicament and disgrace of Mars, but
earnestly labours for his release, and actually becomes
his security for the damages due<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>. What was the cause
of this peculiar interest? It is difficult to conceive the
aim of the Poet in this place. Some have suggested
the comic effect<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> which he has produced by putting
the petition in the mouth of Neptune, whose mere
opinion that Mars would pay was valueless, inasmuch
as he was far too powerful to be called to account by
Vulcan for any thing which he might have said. It
seems to me more likely that, as being, in the possible
absence of Jupiter as well as the goddesses, the senior
and gravest of the deities, he becomes the official
guardian of Olympian decorum; and that he acts here
as the proper person to find an escape from a dilemma
which, while ludicrous, is also embarrassing, and requires
poetically a solution.</p>

<p>Amphitrite, the wife of Neptune in the later my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>thology,
is not so named in Homer, by whom she is
but doubtfully personified. Yet there is, as it were, an
anticipation of the union, in the passage where he tells
us that she rears monster-fishes to do the will of Neptune.
Or it may be meant here, that she is the wife
of Nereus.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His relation to the Phœnicians.</i></div>

<p>The connection of Neptune with the sea naturally
raises the question, whether the introduction of his
worship into Greece can have been owed to the Phœnicians.
For an auxiliary mark, we have the fact that
Ino, of Phœnician extraction, is a strictly maritime
deity<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">νῦν δ’ ἁλὸς ἐν πελάγεσσι θεῶν ἐξέμμορε τιμῆς.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The very frequent intrigues of Neptune with women
may be the mythical dress of the adventures of Phœnician
sailors in this kind: such as that which is recounted<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
in the story of Eumæus. We may notice, too,
that in the Iliad, he does not particularly love the
Greeks, but simply hates the Trojans. He, with Jupiter,
we are told, loved Antilochus<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>. Jupiter, no doubt, because
he had a regard for him as a Greek: Neptune,
plainly, because he was his descendant. And in this
way perhaps we may best explain the connection between
Neptune and some abode in the East, far away
from his own domain. He is absent from the Assembly
of the First Odyssey<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>, among the Ethiopians: and
he sees Ulysses, on his voyage homewards, from afar,
namely off the Solyman mountains; with which we
must suppose he had some permanent tie, as no special
cause is stated for his having been there. It little
accords with his character as a marine god: but it is
in harmony with the view of him as belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
circle of the Phœnician traditions, that he should visit
a nation, of which Homer, I believe, conceived as being
but a little beyond Phœnicia.</p>

<p>But we have still to consider the fragments of information
which concern Neptune, under the third of the
heads above given.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>And to the tradition of the Evil One.</i></div>

<p>No ancient tradition appears to have been split and
shivered into so many fragments in the time of Homer,
as that which related to the Evil Principle. This was
the natural prelude to its becoming, as it shortly afterwards
did, indiscernible to the human eye<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>. Among
these rivulets of tradition, some of the most curious
connect themselves with the name of Neptune, who
was, in his mythological character, prepared to be its
recipient: for in that character he was near to Jupiter
in strength, while his brotherly relation by no means
implied any corresponding tie of affection.</p>

<p>With Juno and Minerva, he took part in the dangerous
rebellion recorded in the First Iliad. He refuses
to join in a combination of Hellenizing gods
against him, on the ground of its hopelessness: but
afterwards, when all others acquiesce in the prohibition,
he alone comes down to aid and excite the
Greeks. The Juno of the Iliad is the active and astute
intriguer against her husband: but it is Neptune, on
whom in effect the burden and responsibility of action
chiefly fall. Still, his principal points of contact with
the traditions of resistance to the Supreme Will are
mediate; and the connection is through his offspring.</p>

<p>In his favourite son, the Cyclops, we have the great
atheist of the poems. It is Providence, and not idols
only, that he rejects, when saying<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>,</p>

gods, seem to have sprung from Neptune<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>. The
Læstrygones, indeed, are not expressly said to be his
children. But they are called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἄνδρεσσιν ἐοικότες,
ἀλλὰ Γίγασιν</span>: and the Giants are expressly declared
to be divinely descended in a speech of Alcinous<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>:</p>

<p>Neptune was the father of Nausithous and the royal
house of Scheria, through Peribœa: but she was daughter
of Eurymedon, and Eurymedon was king of the Giants,
and was the king who led them, with himself, evidently
by rebellion, into ruin<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>;</p>

<p>Thus we have Neptune placed in the relation of ancestor
to the rebellious race, whom it is scarcely possible
to consider as other than identical with the Titans
condemned to Tartarus<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>.</p>

<p>But we have one yet more pointed passage for the
establishment of this strange relationship. In the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεκυΐα</span>
of the Eleventh Odyssey, Ulysses sees, among other
Shades, Iphimedea, the wife of Aloeus, who bore to
Neptune two children<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>, Otus and Ephialtes; hugest of
all creatures upon earth, and also most beautiful, after
Orion. They, the sons of Neptune, while yet children,
threatened war against Olympus, and planned the
piling of the mountains: but Apollo slew them. Thus
this, the most characteristic of all the traditions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Homer relating to the Evil One, hangs upon the person
of Neptune, doubtless because his mythological place
best fitted him for the point of junction. It must be
observed, that Homer has, in bringing these young
giants before us, used a somewhat artificial arrangement.
He does not place them in the realm of Aides
and Persephone, though he describes them to us, in
connection with the figures in that gloomy scene, as
the children of Iphimedea, who appears there in the
first or feminine division. That he does not bring them
before us in conjunction with Tityus and the other
sufferers of that region, can only be because he did not
intend them to be understood as belonging to it: and
it is clear, therefore, that he means us to conceive of
them as having their abode in Tartarus, among the
Titans, doubtless by the side of Eurymedon and his
followers.</p>

<p>We may perceive with peculiar clearness, in the case
of Neptune, the distinction between the elevated prerogatives
of such a deity within his own province, and his
comparative insignificance beyond it. When he traverses
the sea, it exults to open a path for him, and the huge
creatures from its depths sport along his wake. Such
is its sympathy with him, that when he is exciting the
Greeks to war, it too boils and foams upon the shore of
the Hellespont. And not only is maritime nature thus
at his feet, but he has the gift of vision almost without
limit of space, and of knowledge of coming events, so
long as they are maritime. He who knows nothing of
the woes of his son Polyphemus till he is invoked from
the sea-shore, yet can discern Ulysses on his raft from
the far Solyman mountains, and even is aware that he
will escape from his present danger (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀϊζὺς ἥ μιν ἱκάνει</span>)
by reaching the shore of Scheria. This knowledge is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
shared by the minor goddess Leucothee: and doubtless
on the same principle, namely, that it is marine knowledge.
So he can predict to Tyro that there will be
more than one child born to her: here, too, he speaks
of what is personal to himself. When we take Neptune
out of his province, we find none of these extraordinary
gifts, no sign of a peculiar subjugation of
nature or of man to him. He shares in the government
of the world only as a vast force, which it will
cost Jupiter trouble to subdue. Even within his own
domain some stubborn phenomena of nature impose
limits on his power: for we are told he would not be
able, even were he willing, to save Ulysses from Charybdis<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the sublime idea of one Governor
of the universe, omnipotent over all its parts, was
shivered into many fragments, and these high prerogatives,
distributed and held in severalty, are the fragments
of a conception too weighty and too comprehensive
for the unassisted human mind to carry in its
entireness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His grandeur is material.</i></div>

<p>Upon the whole, the intellectual spark in Neptune
is feeble, and the conception is much materialized.
Ideally he has the relation to Jupiter, which the statue
of the Nile bears to one of Jupiter’s statues. Within
these limits, his position is grand. The ceaseless motion,
the unconquerable might, the wide extent, of the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάλασσα</span>, compose for him a noble monarchy. At first
sight, when we read of the lottery of the universe, we
are startled at finding the earth left without an owner.
It was not so in the Asiatic religions. But mark here
the influence of external circumstances. The nations
of Asia inhabited a vast continent; for them land was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
greater by far than sea. The Greeks knew of nothing
but islands and peninsulas of limited extent, whereas
the Sea for them was infinite; since, except round the
Ægean, they knew little or nothing of its farther
shores. Thus the sceptre of Neptune reaches over the
whole of the Outer Geography; while Earth, as commonly
understood, had long been left behind upon the
course of the adventurous Ulysses.</p>

<h3><i>Aidoneus.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Aidoneus of Homer.</i></div>

<p>There is a marked contrast between the mere rank of
Aides or Aidoneus, and his want of substance and of
activity, in the poems. He is one of the three Kronid
Brothers, of whom Neptune asserts&mdash;and we are nowhere
told that it is an unwarrantable boast&mdash;that
they are of equal dignity and honour. He bears the
lofty title of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς καταχθόνιος</span>: and he is the husband
of Persephone the Awful. It is plain that he belonged
of right to the order of Olympian deities, because
Dione states that he repaired to the divine abode, to
have the wounds healed there by Paieon, which he had
received from Hercules: but it is very doubtful whether
we ought to understand him to have attended
even the great Chapter, or Assembly, of the Twentieth
Iliad. His ordinary residence is exclusively in the
nether world. At the same time there is, in his position,
and in that of Persephone, a remarkable independence.
This the very title of subterranean Jupiter is enough
to indicate. Neptune is never called the Jupiter of
the sea. And it is quite plain that the power of
Jupiter over the dead was limited. We cannot say it
was null: for Castor and Pollux after death are still
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τιμὴν πρὸς Ζῆνος ἔχοντες</span>, and they live accordingly on
alternate days. But it was Minerva who interfered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
carry Hercules safely through the Shades, and bring
him back; and it appears that but for her Jupiter would
not have been able to give effect to his design<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>.</p>

<p>But the share of action ascribed to this divinity in
any part of the poems is a very small one. In the
Twentieth Iliad, the tramp of the Immortals, when
engaged in fight, and the quaking of the earth under
the might of Neptune, cause him to tremble. And
his having received wounds from Hercules, though he
shared this indignity with Juno, detracts from his mythological
greatness.</p>

<p>Love of symmetry has sometimes led writers on the
Greek mythology to find matrimonial arrangements
for Jupiter’s brothers similar to his own, by giving to
Neptune Amphitrite, and to Aidoneus Persephone,
for their respective wives. The former of these two
unions has no foundation in Homer; and the latter
bears little analogy to that of Jupiter and Juno. For
Proserpine is the real Queen of the Shades below: all
the higher traditions and active duties of the place
centre around her, while he appears there as a sort of
King-Consort. There is no sign whatever of his exercising
any influence over her, far less of her acting in
the capacity of his organ. And while she has a cult
or worship on earth, he apparently has none.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, we do not expect to find
her exhibiting any tokens of derivation from, or ideal
dependance on him. They would appear to be respectively
derived from traditions of independent origin.</p>

<p>Homer has not attached marks to Aidoneus which
would enable us to trace him to any particular source
beyond the limits of the Olympian system. It would
be natural to seek his prototype among the darkest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and earthiest of the elemental powers. But he appears
before us in the poems rather as an independent and
Hellenic creation, metaphysical in kind, and representing
little beyond (1), a place in the trine number of the
Kronid Brothers, which appears to be the Hellenic
form of a great primitive tradition of a Trinity in the
Godhead; and (2), the consciousness that there was a
city and a government of the dead, and that a ruler
must be provided for them, while the idea of the
Supreme Deity had not retained enough of force and
comprehensiveness to seem sufficient for the purpose.</p>

<p>As the representative of inexorable death, Aidoneus
was the opposite of the bright and life-giving Apollo:
and was naturally the most hateful to mortals of all
the Olympian deities<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>. But the place in which the
idea of punishment centres is the domain of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>
rather than that of Aides: and he is the ruler over a
state of the dead which is generally neither bliss nor
acute suffering, but which is deeply overspread with
chillness and gloom.</p>

<p>I shall refer hereafter<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> to the peculiar relation which
appears to subsist between Aidoneus, together with
Persephone, and the mysterious <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span>.</p>

<h3><i>Demeter, or Ceres.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Ceres or Demeter of Homer.</i></div>

<p>The goddess Demeter, the Ceres of the Latins,
though afterwards of considerable dignity and importance,
is but a feeble luminary in the Homeric
heavens. That there are in the Iliad<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> only two distinct
notices of her personality, might of itself be compatible
with a contrary supposition: for in the <i>Troica</i>
he introduces his divine personages on account of their
relation to the subject, rather than for their general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
importance; and corn, which feeds man, has little
affinity with war, which destroys him. But her weight
is, if possible, even smaller in the Odyssey, where she
is noticed but once<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>, and that incidentally.</p>

<p>The use of the phrase <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δημήτερος ἀκτὴ</span> for corn, like
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φλὸξ Ἡφαίστοιο</span> for Vulcan, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄρης</span> for the
spear, or for the battle, tends to indicate imperfect
personality; to show that the deity was indistinctly
realized; that the personal name was either recent or
at least unfamiliar; and that it was used, not so much
to designate a being, as to give life to an idea.</p>

<p>Homer has not asserted any connection between Demeter
and Persephone: and the idea of it in later times
may have arisen simply from the observation that in
the poems Demeter stands as a mother without a child,
and Persephone as a daughter without a mother.</p>

<p>Possibly, however, the connection may have been
suggested by the name; which seems manifestly to be
equivalent to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γῆ μήτηρ</span> or Mother-Earth. And though
the original reference was to the production of food
by which man lives, the word might be susceptible of
another sense, connecting it with the nether world,
which had a material relation to Earth, and which,
even in Homer, Tityus the son of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γαῖα</span>, and in the
later tradition the earth-born race generally, were reputed
to inhabit.</p>

<p>The name in its proper sense indicates first the idea,
and then the goddess of agriculture: and points to a
Pelasgian, and perhaps farther back an Egyptian,
rather than an Hellenic or a Phœnician connection.
In Egypt, according to the reports collected by Diodorus<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>,
Isis was held nearly to correspond with her.</p>

<p>With this supposition agree the only notices con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>tained
in the poems that tend to attach the goddess
Demeter to a particular locality. Her connection with
Iasion was probably in Crete or Cyprus, or at any rate
(from the name) in some country occupied, and ruled
too, by Pelasgians. Her <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέμενος</span><a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> or dedicated lands in
Thessaly, the Pelasgic Argos, suggest a similar presumption.
In Middle Greece and Peloponnesus we
never hear of her. The very solemn and ancient observance
of her worship in Attica, which was so eminently
a Pelasgian state in the time of Homer, entirely
accords with the indications of the Homeric text.</p>

<p>The slight notice she obtains from Homer, compared
with the dignity to which other tokens would tend to
show that she was entitled, may have been owing to
the incomplete amalgamation in his time of Hellenic
and Pelasgian institutions.</p>

<p>Upon this goddess, as upon so many others, sensual
passion had laid hold. This is decidedly confirmatory
of her Pelasgian or eastern, as opposed to properly
Hellic associations. We see Venus coming from the
east and worshipped in Pelasgian countries: of the
three persons whom Aurora appropriates, Orion is
pretty evidently the subject of a naturalized eastern
tradition, and Tithonus is Asiatic: Calypso and Circe
belong to the east by Phœnicia: it is in Troas and
Asia that no less than three Nymphs appear as the
bearers of children, fighting on the Trojan side, to human
fathers<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>. Whereas among the more Hellenic deities,
we have Minerva and Proserpine wholly exempt;
and Juno using sensual passion it is true, but only for
a political end. This assemblage of facts further confirms
the supposition, that Ceres ought to be set down
as a Pelasgian deity. Orion and Ino, shining in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
heavens, seem to belong to the more astronomical form
of eastern religion: Ceres to that which was probably
transmitted through fertile and well-cultivated Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her place in Olympus.</i></div>

<p>The title of Demeter to rank with the Olympian
deities of Homer is not so absolutely clear, as that of
many among them: but it may on the whole be sufficiently
inferred from the arrangement of the passage in
the Fourteenth Odyssey, where Jupiter recites a list of
the various partners to whom he owed his offspring. The
three first are women, who bore sons never deified, Pirithous,
Perseus, and Minos: the two next are women, of
whom one gave birth to Dionysus a god, the other to the
substantially deified Hercules. The sixth and seventh
are Demeter, or Ceres, and Latona; the children of
neither are mentioned. Besides that Demeter is called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλλιπλόκαμος ἄνασσα</span>, the two seem to be coupled together
as goddesses. The structure of the passage is
not chronological, but depends upon dignity advancing
regularly towards a climax; so purposely indeed, that
Dionysus, always an immortal, is mentioned after Hercules,
a mortal born, though Semele had been named
before Alcmene. All this appears to require the adoption
of the conclusion, that Demeter was reckoned as
an Olympian goddess in the Homeric system.</p>

<p>There is, however, another and more comprehensive
solution of the question which arises out of the faint
notices of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δημήτηρ</span> in Homer. We ought, perhaps, to
consider her as the Pelasgian, and Juno as the Hellenic,
reproduction of those eastern traditions, which gave
mythological impersonation to the female principle.
They naturally centred upon the Earth as the recipient
of productive influences, and as the great nurse and
feeder of man, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τραφερὴ</span>, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πολύφορβος</span>, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πουλυβότειρα</span>,
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζείδωρος</span>. The Pelasgic Demeter may be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
very fair and close copy, in all probability, from these
traditions as they existed in Egypt. But when the
same materials were presented to the Hellenic mind,
they could not satisfy its active and idealizing fancy.
For the Hellene, man was greater than nature: so that
the great office of Jupiter as king of air was subordinated
to his yet more august function as the supreme
superintendent and controller of human affairs. As
the political idea thus predominated in the chief of the
Hellenic Immortals, it was requisite that a similar predominance
of the intellectual and organizing element
should be obtained in his divine Mate. Traditions,
however, that had their root in earth, were of necessity
wholly intractable for such a purpose, although the
lighter and more spirit-like fabric of air was less unsuited
to it. Earth was heavy, inactive; and was the
prime representative of matter as opposed to mind.
Hence the personality of the tradition was severed by
the Greeks from its material groundwork; and Earth,
the Nature-power, remained beneath, while the figure
of Juno, relieved from this incumbrance, and invested
with majestic and vigorous attributes, soared aloft
and took the place of eldest sister and first wife of
Jupiter. Hence doubtless it is that the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γαῖα</span> of Homer
is so inanimate and weakling: because she was but the
exhausted residue of a tradition, from which the higher
life had escaped. But the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἥρη</span> and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γαῖα</span>, according
to this hypothesis, made up between them a full
representation of the traditions from the East, relating
to the chief female form of deity. This being so, no
legitimate place was left in the mythology of Homer for
Ceres; as she had nothing to represent but the same tradition
in a form far less adapted to the Hellenic mind, a
form indeed which it had probably repudiated. Hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
while the Olympian system was young, and Juno not
wholly severed from her Oriental origin, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γῆ μήτηρ</span>
could not but remain a mere outlier. But as the
poetry of the system was developed, and its philosophy
submerged and forgotten, this difficulty diminished,
and the later mythology found an ample space for Ceres
as a great elemental power.</p>

<p>I may, then, observe, in conclusion, that the whole of
this hypothesis is eminently agreeable to the Homeric
representation of Ceres in its four main branches, (1) as
Pelasgian, (2) as subject to lustful passion, (3) as a
secondary wife of Jupiter, and (4) as immediately associated
with productive Earth.</p>

<h3><i><a id="Persephone"></a>Persephone.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Persephone of Homer.</i></div>

<p>Although the Persephone of Homer is rarely brought
before us, and our information respecting her is therefore
slight, there seems to be sufficient ground for
asserting that she is not the mere female reflection of
Hades or Aidoneus.</p>

<p>It is only for those deities from whom other deities
are drawn by descent, that we find in Homer a regular
conjugal connection provided. Thus Neptune, as we
have seen, cannot be said to have a wife in Homer.
Amphitrite appears in the poems with a faint and indeed
altogether doubtful personality, though she afterwards
grew into his spouse. Now Neptune was a
deity much more in view than Aides: and it is not
likely that we should have found Persephone more fully
developed than Amphitrite, had she not represented
some older and more independent tradition.</p>

<p>Again, in cases where the female deity is the mere
reflection of the male, we do not find her invested
with a share in his dominion, although, as in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of Juno, she may occasionally and derivatively exercise
some of the prerogatives, which in him have a higher
and more unquestionable activity. Thus Tartarus is
the region of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>, not of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ῥέα</span>; air is the realm of
Jupiter, not of Jupiter and Juno. But Persephone
appears by the side of Hades as a substantive person;
she is invoked with him by Althea to slay Meleager,
in the Legend of the Ninth Iliad<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>: and the region in
which she dwells is not less hers than his<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">εἰς Ἀΐδαο δόμους καὶ ἐπαινῆς Περσεφονείης.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Indeed her personality is the better developed of the
two: for no personal act is ascribed in the poems to
Aides, except the indeterminate one of trembling, at
the battle of the gods, lest the crust of earth should be
broken through: and the name given him in the Iliad
of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς καταχθόνιος</span>, subterranean Jupiter, may possibly
suggest that he was sometimes viewed as hardly more
than a form or function of the highest god: whereas, in
the under-world of the Eleventh Odyssey, all the active
functions of sovereignty are placed in her hands. It is
she who gathers the women-shades for Ulysses: and it
is she who disperses them when they have been passed
in review. It is by her that Ulysses apprehends the
head of Gorgo may be sent forth to drive him off,
should he linger too long; it is by her that he apprehends
he may have been deluded with an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴδωλον</span> or
shade, instead of a substance; most of all, it is she who
endows Tiresias, alone among the dead, with the character
of the Seer<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>. In fine, the whole of the active duties
of the nether kingdom appear to be in her hands.</p>

<p>That she was generally worshipped by the Hellenic
tribes we must infer from the cases mentioned in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Ninth Iliad, the one in Ætolia, the other farther
North<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>; as well as from her office in regard to the
thoroughly national region of the Shades.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her marked and substantive character.</i></div>

<p>She has her own strongly marked set of epithets.
Of these, one is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁγνὴ</span>, the severely pure; for with
Homer <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁγνὸς</span> is exclusively applicable to divine womanhood,
and is given only to Diana and Persephone: then
she is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαυὴ</span>, the dread: and lastly, she is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπαινὴ</span>, an
epithet appropriated to her exclusively, which appears
to be Homer’s favourite method for sharply marking
out individuality of character. Buttmann has also
well observed, that she has this epithet only when
mentioned along with Hades, that is, when shown very
strictly in her official character; and that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαυὴ</span> is used
when she appears alone. Upon this he observes; ‘this
way of joining the name of Proserpine with that of
Pluto was an old epic formula, handed down even to
Homer and our oldest Greek poets from still earlier
times, and which they used unchanged<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>.’ He would
read <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπ’ αἰνὴ</span>, instead of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπαινὴ</span>, but this neither affects
the sense (awful, terrible) nor the force of the exclusive
appropriation.</p>

<p>There is another sign confirmatory of the belief that
the origin of this mythical person must be sought, not
in the necessity of finding a queen for Aidoneus, but
in an anterior and distinct tradition. Namely, this;
that, though she is a daughter of Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>, she is not
provided with a mother. Thus she seems as if she
were older than the Olympian œconomy. Venus, Mars,
Vulcan, Mercury, are all equipped with a full parentage.
The later tradition, which made Persephone the daughter
of Ceres, has no other support from Homer than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
this, that we are left to suppose that Ceres had some
offspring by Jupiter, while none is named<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>.</p>

<p>The chain of presumptions appears to me to become
complete, when we take into view two other pieces of
evidence supplied by the poems. In the far East<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>, beyond
the couch of the morning Sun, some distance up
the stream of the great river Ocean, but to the south of
the point where it is entered, and at a spot where the
shore narrows very much&mdash;immediately, in short, before
the point of descent&mdash;are the groves of Persephone.
According to the general rules of interpretation applicable
to Homer, this appears to convey to us that the
seat of her worship was in the far Southern East, and
that her office, as there understood, was that of the
goddess or queen of Death. And if she is indeed the
reflection, in the mirror of the lower world, of any
other known deity, then, both from this great office, and
from the peculiar epithet <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁγνὴ</span>, it is most likely to be
of Diana, with whom, in the later mythology, she was
identified; and, again, through Diana, of Apollo, from
whom the light of Diana herself was derived. Or, in
other words, she may be for the lower world that reflection
of Apollo, which the Homeric Diana was for
this earth: and it is worth observation, that the gift of
second sight, which she allows to Tiresias, and which
therefore is at her disposal beneath ground<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>, is the
peculiar and exclusive property of Apollo.</p>

<p>Let us now lastly consider, what light the etymology
of her remarkable name may afford us. Its meaning
appears to be, either destruction by slaughter; from two
roots, one that represented in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔπερσα</span>, from the verb
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέρθω</span>, and the other <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φόνη</span>; or else, that of the destruc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>tion
or slaughter of Persians. In the former view, the
evidence leaves us where we were, or brings us a point
nearer to Diana, whose function was not that of all
death whatever, but of such death as might be called
slaughter, because not due to disease, but brought
about at the moment by a sudden process, though
often the mildest of all ways of dying<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>. But the other
etymology may be worth some further attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her connection with the East</i>.</div>

<p>Besides that cluster of traditions, relating to remote
places, which the Greeks derived from the Phœnician
navigators, and which cannot but have included some
eastward wanderings in the Black Sea, as well as westward
experience in the Mediterranean, they must in all
likelihood have had oriental traditions properly their
own, brought by their Hellic forefathers with them
from their cradle. We have already seen that that
cradle was probably Persia; and we have found traces
of the connection in the name of the great pre-Achæan
hero, Perseus, and in the continuing use of that name
in the high Achæan family of Nestor, as well as at
much later historic dates. Another link, connecting
the Homeric traditions with this name, and both with
the East, is found in the name of Perse, who was the
mother of Circe, an Eastern goddess; and who was
the daughter of Ocean, and the wife of the Sun<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>.</p>

<p>We must take these circumstances into view along
with the force of the name Persephone, and with the
evidence we have already had of the antiquity of the
traditions relating to her. To this we have to add the
absence of any Homeric evidence connecting her with
any other local source. There is no sign of any institution,
that belonged to her worship, except in those
groves planted in the far East; and no sign of any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
particular locality marked as her peculiar abode, which
we have found to be a mark of such invented deities
generally as had a well developed personality. There
is no note of her whatever in Troas; and nothing to
connect her with Egypt, or with the Pelasgians in any
quarter. It is not likely that she came in with the
Phœnicians, as she would then have had signs of a
recent origin, and would not have attained to so august
and mysterious a position as she actually holds. The
two distinct notices of her worship are both in the
Homeric Hellas; not in Southern Greece, nor in the
islands.</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, on every ground reasonable to
suppose, that the tradition of Proserpine was an original
Hellic tradition brought into the country from
the East, probably by the Hellic tribes, and from among
their Persian forefathers; and that the name of the
deity, as we find it in Homer, affords a new indication
of the extraction of the race.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the unusually substantive aspect of her
position in the nether world, which makes her relation
to Aidoneus so different from that of the other mythological
wives, or feminines, to their respective husbands,
is such, that it seems most reasonable, instead of deriving
her from him, as Juno was derived from Jupiter,
or Tethys from Ocean, to consider them as representing
the union of two independent impersonations, associated
together primarily by their common subject matter.
For there does not seem to be any thing improbable in
the hypothesis, that Persephone may, in the belief of
some country and age, have served alone for the ruler
of the region of the dead. Just as so many subordinate
ministers of Doom, the Fates, the Erinues, and the
Harpies, assumed the female form in the process of im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>personation,
so it may have been with their sovereign.
And if we are to look farther for the metaphysical
groundwork of such a tradition, we may perhaps find
it as follows. There is a relation of analogy between
each function and its converse: and as in the pure mythology,
all that gave life was feminine, so conversely,
all that represented the destroying agency might assume
a similar form.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her relation to Olympus</i>.</div>

<p>In her case, as in that of one or two others, it is difficult
to discover whether Homer meant a particular deity to
be included, or not, among the Olympian gods of the ordinary
or smaller assembly. There is no indication in
the poems, which directly connects Persephone with
Olympus; and that celestial palace may seem to belong
to the government of the living world, and to be almost
incapable of relations with that of the departed.
Nor is she connected specially with the Olympian system,
like Aidoneus, by the position which birth confers.
The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλσος</span>, and the worship paid her there, can hardly
belong to the departed spirits on their way to their
abode, and more probably indicate an ancient tradition
deriving her worship from the far East. On the other
hand, her dignity and majesty in the poems are unquestionable,
and indeed superior to those of any
Olympian deity, after some five or six. I do not find
materials for a confident judgment on the Homeric
view of her place in his theo-mythology, with reference
to this particular point of connection with Olympus.</p>

<p>Founding conjecture upon the facts before us, I venture,
however, on a further extension of these hypotheses
with respect to Persephone. We perceive in
Persephone and Diana that kind of likeness which
may be due to their common origin; if, as we suppose,
both were images of Apollo. But it is not likely that
two such images should have been formed by the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
race for itself. Can we then, probably refer Diana and
Persephone to different sources ethnically?</p>

<p>It is plain that Diana was worshipped in Troy and
Greece. Persephone, so far as we know, in Greece
only. This would agree with the supposition that
Diana was originally Pelasgian, Persephone only Hellic.</p>

<p>Again, Diana was an earthly, Persephone a subterraneous
reflection of Apollo. Now the Hellic tribes
were lively believers in a future state: as we see from
the communion of Achilles with the soul of Patroclus,
and from many places in the Odyssey. But we have
nowhere in Homer the slightest allusion among the
Trojans to the belief in a future state, beyond the
mere formula of entering the region of Aïdes. Neither
the succinct account of the funeral rites of Hector, nor
any one of the three addresses over his remains, contain
the slightest allusion to his separate existence as a
spirit. There is, indeed, mention of wine used to extinguish
the flame of the funeral pile, but none of invocation
along with it, as there is in the case of
Patroclus<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>. And as we have no less than an hundred
lines spoken over or otherwise bestowed upon the dead
Hector, the omission is singular. It becomes still more
significant, when we recollect that the Greeks, and their
goddess Juno, invoke the deities of the under-world,
and the powers connected with a future state, in their
solemn oaths and imprecations<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>; but when Hector
swears to Dolon, (our only example of a Trojan oath,)
he adjures Jupiter alone<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>. Now it may be that
the religion of Troy did not include so distinct a reference
to a future state, as that of Greece, and that
the Trojans knew nothing of Persephone, or of any
deity holding her place. This hypothesis would at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
accord with the features of the Homeric portrait, and
with the striking absence among the Trojans of all
pointed reference to a future life, or to the disembodied
spirit. Nor need we consider it to be at all shaken by
slight and formal allusions, or by the words in which
Homer on his own part dismisses to Hades the spirit
of the slain Hector<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>. The hypothesis which the circumstances
appear to suggest is, not that the Trojans
disbelieved a future existence, but that they neither
felt keenly respecting it, nor gave a mythological development
to the doctrine.</p>

<h3><i>Mars.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Mars of Homer.</i></div>

<p>Even in Homer, Mars is externally the most imposing
figure among the masculine deities of pure invention.
The greatest of war-bards could not but find
him a fine subject for poetical amplification. But in the
Roman period he had far outgrown the limits of his
Homeric position. With the lapse of time, the forces
and passions, which gave to this impersonation its hold
upon human nature, were sure to prevail in a considerable
degree over the finer elements from which
Apollo was moulded. It requires an effort of mind
to liberate ourselves from the associations of the later
mythology, and contract our vision for the purpose of
estimating the Mars of Homer as he really is.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his stature, beauty, hand and voice,
which constitute, taken together, a proud appearance,
it seems as if Mars had stood lower in the mind of
Homer than any Olympian deity who takes part in the
Trojan war, except Venus only.</p>

<p>The Odyssey never once brings Mars before us, even
by way of allusion, except in the licentious lay of De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>modocus;
and the spirit of that lay certainly seems to
aim at making him ridiculous, especially in the manner
of his release and withdrawal. In the Iliad his part is,
of course, more considerable; but on no occasion whatever
does Homer apparently seek to set him off, or
give him a commanding attitude in comparison with
other deities.</p>

<p>We have nowhere any account of any act of reverence
or worship done to him, either in or out of Greece.
For instance, he is never, even in the contingencies of
war, the object of prayer. He never shows command
over the powers of nature, or the mind of man; which
he nowhere attempts to influence by suggestion. It is
said, indeed, that he entered into Hector, as that warrior
was putting on the armour of Achilles;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent18">δῦ δέ μιν Ἄρης</div>
       <div class="verse">δεινὸς Ἐνυάλιος<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But no words could more conclusively fix his place
in the Homeric system as the mere impersonation of a
Passion. For with Homer no greater deity, indeed, no
other of the Olympian gods, is ever said to enter into
the mind of a mortal man. In the Fifth Book he
stirs up the warlike passion of Menelaus; having, like
Venus, a limited hold upon a particular propensity.
His climax of honour in this department is his giving
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάρσος</span> to the Pseudo-Ulysses; but this he does only
in conjunction with Minerva<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His limited worship and attributes.</i></div>

<p>His possession of the attributes of deity appears to
have been most limited. The use of the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄρης</span>
not only for the passion of war, but even for its weapons,
shows us that the impersonation was in this case
as yet very partially disengaged from the metaphysical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
ideas, or the material objects, in which it took its
rise.</p>

<p>His function as god of war was confined to the
merely material side of war, and had nothing to do with
that aspect, in which war enlists and exhausts all the
higher faculties of the human mind; so much so, indeed,
that to be a great general is almost necessary in
order to enter the first rank of greatness at all. Even
of war in the lower sense he had not, as a god, exclusive
possession, but he administered his office in partnership
with a superior, Minerva. Besides being every
thing else that she was, she presided, along with him,
over war. On the shield of Achilles, he and Minerva
lead the opposing hosts<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>. Over the body of Patroclus
the struggle was one of which, says the Poet, neither
Mars nor Minerva could think lightly<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>. Achilles,
when pursuing the Trojans, calls for assistance; for,
says he, neither Mars nor Minerva could undertake to
dispose of such a multitude<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>. Mars and Minerva, says
Jupiter, will take charge of the concerns of war<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>.</p>

<p>But that in this partnership he was an inferior, and
not an equal, is clear from the manner in which he is
habitually handled by Minerva. She wounds him
through the spear of Diomed, when, unless saved by
flight, he himself apprehends he might have perished<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>.
In the Theomachy, she twice over strikes him powerless
to the ground. In the Olympian meeting of the
Fifteenth Book, when his intended visit to the battlefield
menaces the gods with trouble from the displeasure
of Jupiter, Minerva strips his armour off his back,
scolds him sharply, and replaces him in his seat<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
she is pointed out by Jupiter as the person, whose habitual
duty it was to keep him in order by the severest
means<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἥ ἑ μάλιστ’ εἴωθε κακῇς ὀδύνῃσι πελάζειν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the Fifth Iliad, he stirs up the Trojans, and envelopes
the fight in darkness: but here he is acting
under <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐφετμαὶ</span>, or injunctions from Apollo<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>, who thus
appears, like Minerva, in the light of a superior to him,
even in his own department.</p>

<p>We learn, again, that he was overcome and imprisoned
by the youths Otus and Ephialtes, whom
Apollo subdued: he was in bondage for thirteen
months, and would have perished, had not Mercury
released him<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>.</p>

<p>He is able to assume the human figure, and, as we
have seen, to bring darkness over contending hosts:
but, when in Olympus, he remains ignorant<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> of the
death of his son Ascalaphus, until he receives the information
from Juno; as it was only from his Nymphs
that the Sun learned the slaughter of his oxen. Nay,
Minerva even puts on a particular helmet, in order
that it may secure her from being recognised by Mars
when within his view<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>.</p>

<p>Mars in the Olympian court bears some resemblance
to Ajax among the Grecian heroes. But the intellectual
element, which appears to be simply blunt in
Ajax, in Mars seems to be wholly wanting: so that he
represents an animal principle in its crudest form: and
is not so much an Ajax, as a Caliban.</p>

<p>We are not told that he is greedy of sacrifices, for
no <i>cultus</i> is assigned to him: but he is represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
as greedy of blood, and as capable of being satiated
with it<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>.</p>

<p>Except with Venus for his mere person, he has no
favour with any other Olympian deities<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>. Juno describes
him as lawless and as a fool: and Jupiter tells
him that, were he the son of any other deity but himself,
he would long ago have been ejected from his
place in heaven<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>.</p>

<p>On one occasion, his name is associated with those
of Agamemnon and Neptune: but the due relation
between them is still preserved. Agamemnon is compared
with Jupiter as to his face and head; with
Neptune as to his chest; and with Mars as to his
waist. The eyes of Hector on the field of battle were
like the Gorgon, and like Mars<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>.</p>

<p>From the repeated allusions to contingencies in
which he would have perished, there seems to be
something more or less equivocal even about his title
to immortality. If more, he is also much less, than
man. He is perhaps the least human of the Olympian
family; and is a compound between deity and brute.</p>

<p>The exhibitions of Mars, as wounded by Diomed for
the Iliad, and in the lay of Demodocus for the Odyssey,
seem to imply that this deity could not, in the time of
Homer, have become an object of general or established
religious worship in Greece.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mars as yet scarcely Greek.</i></div>

<p>He is a local deity, and his abode is in Thrace.
From thence he issues forth with his mythical son
Terror to make war upon the Ephyri: a race whose name
has a strong Greek savour, and whose hostile relation
to Mars thus exhibited, tends, with other evidence, to
place him in the category of foreign deities, not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
naturalized in the country, though made available by
Homer for his Olympian Court. After the detection
in the palace of Vulcan, it is to Thrace that he
again repairs.</p>

<p>We are not to consider this paramount Thracian
relation as absolutely separating him from Greece:
Thracians, like Pelasgi, had links with both parties in
the war, though the stronger ones are apparently those
which connect them with Troy.</p>

<p>He has among the deities the nickname of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλλοπρόσαλλος</span>,
or turncoat, because of his vacillation between
the two parties. This singular epithet, applied to the
Thracian god, conveys the idea that Homer, knowing
of the sympathies of the name with both sides, was
puzzled as to placing him decisively on either. Now
the Thracians of Homer were <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκρόκομοι</span><a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>, while the
Achæans were <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καρηκομόωντες</span>. And it is worth notice
that the Germans of Tacitus, among whom we find
marked signs of resemblance to the Hellenic tribes,
wore in general flowing hair, but the Suevi, one particular
tribe of them, on the contrary, gathered it into
a knot<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>.</p>

<p>Mars, however, incurs the particular wrath of Juno
by abandoning the party of the Greeks, and siding with
the Trojans. But in the Fifteenth Book, where Juno
acquaints him of the death of his son, who had fought
in the Greek ranks, she evidently does it in the expectation
that grief and resentment will once more make
him a foe to the Trojans. And her calculation is well
founded: for he is setting out with that intention,
when Minerva follows, and roughly brings him back.</p>

<p>He only appears once in a pre-Troic legend. This
appearance, too, is beyond the borders of Greece. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Lycia he, or, it may be, simply warlike passion which
he represents, slays Isander, the son of Bellerophon
and uncle of Glaucus, in battle with the Solymi. Still
he is the father by Astyoche, of Ascalaphus and Ialmenus,
somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Minyeian
Orchomenus, or else farther towards the north of
Greece.</p>

<p>The Homeric indications, on the whole, as well as
the general conceptions of the character, represent
Mars as neither a deity indigenous to the country, nor
one belonging to the Hellenic traditions: while the
Poet perhaps intends us to understand that he had
points of contact or affinity with Greece, which are represented
in his wavering attitude between the two
parties to the war. It is probable that the Poet himself
may have been a principal agent in the introduction
of Mars to Hellenic worship. The machinery of
the Iliad required him to find an array of gods, who
should be champions on each side respectively. It
also required that these gods should be united round a
centre, which he provided for them in Olympus and in
its Court, under the presidency of Jupiter. Both Mars
and Venus may thus have made good a title, which
before was doubtful and imperfect, through the place
to which they were promoted in the Iliad, combined
with the place which the Iliad itself won for itself in
the national understanding and affections.</p>

<h3><i>Mercury.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Mercury of Homer.</i></div>

<p>The Homeric signs respecting Mercury are sufficient
to fix his character and origin. The small part, which
this deity plays in the poems, is indeed in remarkable
contrast with the extended popularity to which at a
later period he attained: but his character in Homer is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
one which accounts in a natural manner for the subsequent
increase in his importance.</p>

<p>He is the son of Maias, Od. xiv. 435; and of Jupiter,
Od. viii. 335.</p>

<p>He is the man of business for the Olympian deities,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διάκτορος</span>. Od. viii. 335. v. 28<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>.</p>

<p>He is the giver of increase, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῶτορ ἐάων</span>. Od. viii. 335.
Il. xiv. 490.</p>

<p>He is the most sociable of deities, Il. xxiv. 334. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σοὶ
γάρ τε μάλιστά γε φίλτατόν ἐστιν ἀνδρὶ ἑταίρισσαι</span>.</p>

<p>The extraction of Mercury stands somewhat obscurely
in Homer: his mother Maias is but once
mentioned, and then without any clue. But, in the
ancient hymn to Mercury, she is declared to be the
daughter of Atlas: and if this be so, we shall be justified
in considering him as the child of a Phœnician
tradition<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>. This is also clear on Homeric grounds.
Although Homer does not expressly connect him with
Atlas, he makes Calypso, the daughter of that personage,
address him as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδοῖός τε φίλος τε</span>. These expressions
are usually applied by him where there is some
special relation of consanguinity, affinity, or guestship:
as between Jupiter and his adopted child<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> and particular
friend Thetis. It is therefore probable that
Homer took Mercury’s mother Maias to be, as the
after-tradition made her, the sister of Calypso, and the
daughter of Atlas. All the other Homeric signs of
him are in complete harmony with this hypothesis of a
Phœnician origin for Mercury.</p>

<p>We thus understand how he becomes the general
agent for the gods: because the Phœnicians supplied
the first and principal means of communication between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the several nations in the heroic age: they were the
men-of-business for the world<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>.</p>

<p>It thus becomes plain, again, how he can with propriety
be called the giver of comforts or blessings;
because the basis of commerce is this, that each person
engaged in it parts with something which he does not
want, and receives what he does want in return.</p>

<p>The apparent anomaly, which makes the god of increase
also the god of thievery, is thus explained: because,
from its nature, commerce is ever apt to degenerate
partially into fraud; and because, in days of the strong
hand, force as well as intelligence would often make
it easy for the maritime merchants to change their
vocation, for the occasion, into that of plunder<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>.</p>

<p>His proper office in regard to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔργα</span> of men
seems not to be industry, nor skill in production or
manufacture; but handiness and tidiness in the performance
of services. He, says Ulysses, gives to the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔργα</span>, which may mean both the deeds and the industrial
productions of men, their <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χάρις</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κῦδος</span>, their
grace and credit or popularity<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mercury the god of increase.</i></div>

<p>This idea of increase forms the common or central
element of the various attributes assigned to Mercury.
It takes two principal forms, one that of increase in
material goods, the other that of the propagation of
the race. This latter, which was elsewhere grossly
exhibited, is veiled by Homer with his almost unfailing
sense of delicacy, and may not, indeed, have been
fully developed in his time. It is perhaps however
traceable in two passages of the poems: first, that of
the Sixteenth Iliad, where we are told that he corrupted
the virgin Polymele<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>, though she belonged to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
train of Diana. The other is in the episode of Venus
and Mars, where Apollo selects him as the deity to
whom to put the question, whether he would like to
take the place of the adulterer, and he replies in the
affirmative<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>. Each of these incidents seems to appertain
to something distinctive in his character.</p>

<p>That character, again, imports the extended intercourse
with mankind, and the knowledge of the world,
which causes him to be chosen, in the Twenty-Fourth
Iliad, for the difficult office of conducting Priam to the
abode of Ulysses. Moreover, the great balance of
material benefit which commerce brings gives him, its
patron, as a general rule, a genial and philanthropic
aspect. In Homer we have nowhere any sign of his
vengeance, anger, or severity. He neither punishes,
hates, nor is incensed with any one. A passionless and
prudent deity, he not only declines actual fighting with
Latona, as she is a wife of Jupiter, but spontaneously
gives her leave to boast among the gods that she has
engaged and worsted him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mercury Hellenic and Phœnician.</i></div>

<p>The Phœnician origin of Mercury will also account
for his position in the poems, in relation to the Trojans
and Greeks respectively. Not simply is he one of the
five Hellenizing deities: for his talents would naturally
with Homer tend to place him on that side. But
he appears almost wholly unknown to the Trojans.
The abundance of the flocks of Phorbas is indeed referred
to his love (Il. xiv. 490): and he reveals himself
to Priam by his name (Il. xxiv. 460): but it is remarkable,
and contrary to the general rule of the poems,
that Priam, notwithstanding his great obligations,
takes no notice whatever of his deity, either upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
first revelation and departure, or when a second time
he appears, and afterwards quits him anew (682&ndash;94).</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have abundant signs of his
familiarity with the Greeks. He conveys the sceptre
from Jupiter to Pelops: he carries the warning of the
gods to Ægisthus: sacrifice is offered to him in Ithaca:
and he is liberally treated with sacrifices by Autolycus
in Parnesus, where he repays his worshipper by bestowing
on him the arts of perjury and purloining<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>.</p>

<p>Now it is plain, from many places in the poems,
that the Greeks had much intercourse with the Phœnicians.
On the other hand, the Trojans, wealthy by
internal products and home trade, seem to have known
little or nothing of maritime commerce. Their intercourse
with Thrace, the fertile Thrace that furnished a
contingent of allies, required no more than that they
should have the means of crossing the Straits of Gallipoli.
We nowhere hear that they had a port or harbour.
A Phœnician deity would therefore, of course,
be on the Achæan side during the war.</p>

<p>Independently of such an origin, he might, in his
usual capacity of agent, have been with perfect propriety
sent to Calypso: but his mythical relationship
to her as a nephew, and her evident connection with
Phœnician traditions, give a peculiar propriety to his
employment on this errand.</p>

<p>Another passage of the Odyssey seems, however, to
place this relationship beyond doubt. Ulysses, in the
Twelfth Book, recounts to Alcinous the transaction
that occurred in the Olympian Assembly after his crew
had slain the oxen of the Sun. On that occasion, the
offended deity declared that, unless he got compensation,
he would go down and shine in the realm of Aides; upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
which Jupiter at once promised to destroy the ship of
Ulysses. ‘This,’ adds Ulysses, ‘I heard from Calypso,
and she told me that she had herself heard it from
Mercury<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>.’</p>

<p>Now this was no affair of Calypso’s; none, that is,
on which the gods could make a communication to her
in regard to Ulysses: but it was one in which, from her
passion for the hero, she would take a natural interest,
and on which she might well obtain information from
a deity who was her relative. Nor does it appear on
what other ground Mercury should be named, as the
person who brought her this extra-official report.</p>

<p>Again, it is probably on account of his Phœnician
connection, that the intervention of Mercury is employed
in the Tenth Odyssey<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>, to supply Ulysses with
the instructions that were necessary, in order to enable
him to cope with Circe.</p>

<p>For we are here in the midst of a cluster of traditions,
which we have every reason to presume to be wholly
Phœnician<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>. It is the cluster, which occupies the outer
circle of the geography of the Odyssey: and it is severed
from the Grecian world and experience, not only
by a geographical line, but by an entire change in mythological
relations. From the time when Ulysses
enters that circle in the beginning of the Ninth Book,
until his appearance near Scheria, on the outskirt of
the known familiar sphere, his ancient friend Minerva
nowhere attends him: and there are four whole books
without even a mention of the goddess, who, except for
this interval, stands prominently forth in almost every
page of the Odyssey. The divine aid is given to him,
during this period, through Circe and Calypso; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Mercury is appointed to command the latter, and to
enable Ulysses to overcome the former. Both the
company and the traditions, amidst which Mercury is
found, thus invite us to presume that he is a deity
of Phœnician importation into Greece.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mercury recent in Greece.</i></div>

<p>There is one other point connected with him, which,
tending to mark that he had somewhat recently become
known to the Greeks, agrees with other indications
of his introduction from beyond sea. He figures,
indeed, in legends as old as Hercules and Pelops<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>; and
we do not receive any account of his infancy, as we do
of the infancy of Dionysus and of Vulcan. But we
may observe that, whenever he assumes human form,
it is the form of one scarcely emerging from boyhood.
In the last Iliad, he is a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρῶτον ὑπηνήτης</span>, in the fairest
flower of youth<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>. And in the Tenth Odyssey, where
he makes his second and only other appearance to a
mortal, the same line is repeated in order to describe
his appearance, as if it were an established formula for
himself, and not merely adapted to a particular occasion.
Indeed it may reasonably be questioned, whether
such adaptation exists at all. A very young person
was not the most appropriate conductor for Priam, on
such an errand as that which he had undertaken: nor
the best instructor in the mode of coping with the formidable
Circe. Therefore, without laying too much stress
upon the point, the meaning of the youthful appearance
seems to be, that he was young in the Greek Olympus.</p>

<p>There is yet another sign by which I think we may
identify Mercury as, in the estimation of Homer, a
deity known to be of foreign introduction. The list
given by Jupiter in the Fourteenth Iliad of his intrigues,
includes no reference to Maias, the mother of Mercury,
or to Diana the mother of Venus. Yet it is a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and elaborately constructed list, ending with Juno
herself: and the question arises, on what principle was
it constructed? I think the answer must be that, as it
was addressed to Juno, the most Hellenic of all the
Olympian deities, with whom he wished to be on good
terms at the moment, so also it was intended, if not to
give a full account of his Greek intrigues, yet at any
rate that no tradition should appear in it, except such as
Homer considered to be either native, or fully naturalized.
It contains no reference, for example, to the mother
of Sarpedon, the mother of Dardanus, the mother of
Amphion and Zethus, the mother of Tantalus, (whom
we have however only presumptions for reckoning as by
Homeric tradition a son of Jupiter,) or even the mother
of Æolus; whom it is possible that Homer may have
regarded as Hellic, rather than properly Greek, though
the father of illustrious Greek houses. If this be the
rule, under which the Poet has framed the list, then the
exclusion of Maias and her son remarkably coincides
with the other evidence that tends to define his position
as a deity of known and remembered foreign origin.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>His Olympian office and that of Iris.</i></div>

<p>It may be convenient to notice in this place the
statement which is commonly made, that Iris is the
messenger of the gods in the Iliad, but that Mercury,
except only in the Twenty-fourth Book of that Poem,
is confined in this capacity to the Odyssey: a statement,
on which has been founded a standing popular
argument against the unity of authorship in the two
poems, and also against the genuineness of the Twenty-fourth
Iliad itself.</p>

<p>The statement, however, appears to rest upon a pure
misapprehension; for it assumes the identity of the character
of Iris and Mercury respectively as messengers.
Whereas there is really a difference, corresponding with
the difference in dignity between the two deities: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Homer is in regard to them perfectly consistent with
himself.</p>

<p>Mercury is sometimes a messenger in the proper
sense, and sometimes an agent, or an agent and messenger
combined. It is not true that, so far as the
Iliad is concerned, he only appears in the last Book
in one of these capacities. For in the Second Book<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
we find, that he carried the Pelopid sceptre from Jupiter
to Pelops: which may mean either simply, that
he was the bearer of it, or that by a commission he
assisted Pelops in acquiring, or rather in founding, the
Achæan throne in the Peloponnesus. In the Twenty-fourth
Iliad, Mercury is not really a messenger at all<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>;
but he is an agent, intrusted by Jupiter on the ground
of special fitness with the despatch of a delicate and
important business, the bringing Priam in safety to the
presence of Achilles, and afterwards the withdrawing
him securely from a position of the utmost danger.
This is an office like that undertaken by Minerva in
the Fourth Book, when, as she was commissioned to
bring about a breach of the Pact by the Trojans, she
repaired to Pandarus for the purpose. But the function
of Iris is simply to carry messages, and chiefly
from one deity to another; she is not only <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγγελος</span>,
but <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετάγγελος</span><a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>; she is not intrusted in any case with
the conduct of transactions among men, or responsible
for their issue, although in the Fifteenth Book she
spontaneously advises the god Neptune in the sense of
the message she has brought. It is not for Jupiter
only that she acts: she also conveys a message, and a
clandestine one, for Juno<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>. Nay, on one occasion, without
any divine charge, hearing the prayer of Achilles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
two of the Winds, she spontaneously carries it to the
palace, where they were all feasting together<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>.</p>

<p>Only in the Odyssey do we find Mercury unquestionably
and simply discharging the duty of a messenger;
and this on two occasions: the first, when he
brought to Ægisthus the warning that his crimes, if
committed, would be followed by retribution from the
hand of Orestes; the second, when he communicated
to Calypso the command to release Ulysses.</p>

<p>But there is in reality no discrepancy whatever between
the two poems: inasmuch as Mercury and Iris,
though both messengers, act in different characters.
Iris is in one case the spontaneous messenger, who
carries a hero’s wish to subordinate deities; but she
uniformly has this mark, that she never rises higher
than to be the personal messenger of Jupiter. On the
other hand, Mercury in the Odyssey is the official messenger,
not of Jupiter individually, but in both cases
of the Assembly of the gods: and the care, with which
the distinction seems to be drawn, is very remarkable.
It is true, the message to Calypso is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ζηνὸς ἀγγελίη</span>:
but it became the message of Jupiter, because
it was a proposal made by Minerva in the Olympian
Assembly, and made on the part of all in the plural
number, which was then duly adopted by Jupiter as
the executive head of the body<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">Ἑρμείαν μὲν ἔπειτα, διάκτορον Ἀργειφόντην,</div>
       <div class="verse">νῆσον ἐς Ὠγυγίην ὀτρύνομεν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The message in the case of Ægisthus is equally well
defined<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

       <div class="verse">Ἑρμείαν πέμψαντες.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It would have been out of keeping, therefore, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the character and rank of the Homeric Iris, to give her
the charge of the messages carried by Mercury. The
only case at all analogous in the Iliad is that of the
decision in the Fourth Book: and there not Iris, but
Minerva is employed. It is not, however, true that
we have in the Odyssey no recognition of the character
of Iris as a messenger. We find one, and that
the plainest of all, in the etymology of the name of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἶρος</span> the beggar. His proper name was Arnæus<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>; and
he was called Irus, because he was a messenger:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent10">Ἶρον δὲ νέοι κίκλησκον ἅπαντες,</div>
       <div class="verse">οὕνεκ’ ἀπαγγέλλεσκε κιὼν, ὅτε πού τις ἀνώγοι.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is yet another illustration of the view which
has here been given. In the Assembly of the Twenty-fourth
Iliad, Jupiter, in order to give effect to the
general desire of the gods, has occasion to wish for the
presence of Thetis: and it has at first sight an odd
appearance that he does not, as in other cases where
he is acting singly, call Iris and bid her go: but he
says, with a mode of expression not found elsewhere,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἀλλ’ εἴ τις καλέσειε θεῶν Θέτιν....</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And Iris, hearing him, sets forth without being personally
designated. The peculiar language seems as if
it had been employed for the especial purpose of keeping
Iris within her own province, and of preventing the
possibility of the confusion between her office and that
of deities superior in rank, which might have arisen if
she had regularly received an errand in the midst of
the Olympian Court.</p>

<p>Thus, then, it would appear, that the apparent discrepancy
between the various parts of the poems, when
closely examined, really yields to us fresh evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
their harmony. Nor let it be thought unworthy of
Homer thus minutely to preserve the precedence and
relative dignity of his deities. With our views of the
Olympian scheme, it may require an effort to assume his
standing-ground: but when he was dealing with the
actual religion of his country, it was just as natural and
needful for him to maintain the ranks and distinctions
of the gods, as of men in their various classes. Mythology
might, indeed, afford ample scope to his fancy for
free embellishment and enlargement of the established
traditions; but these processes must always be in the
sense of harmonious development, not of discord.</p>

<p>Another question may indeed be asked: whence came
this idea of twofold messengership, higher and lower?
and would it not have been more natural if the whole
of this function had been intrusted to one deity?
This question is, I believe, just, and requires that a
special account should be given of an arrangement
apparently anomalous. Such an account I have endeavoured
to supply in treating of Iris, by shewing
that she owes her place to a primeval tradition, while
Mercury owes his to an ideal conformity with the laws
of the Olympian system.</p>

<p>And in truth there is no single deity, on whom the
stamp of that system has been more legibly impressed.
It might be said of the Homeric Mercury, that he exceeds
in humanism (to coin a word for the purpose)
the other Olympian gods, as much as they excel the
divinities of any other system. His type is wholly and
purely inventive, without a trace of what is traditional.
He represents, so to speak, the utilitarian side of the
human mind, which was of small account in the age of
Homer, but has since been more esteemed. In the limitation
of his faculties and powers, in the low standard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
his moral habits, in the abundant activity of his appetites,
in his indifference, his ease, his good nature, in
the full-blown exhibition of what Christian Theology
would call conformity to the world, he is, as strictly as
the nature of the case admits, a product of the invention
of man. He is the god of intercourse on earth;
and thus he holds in heaven by mythological title, what
came to Iris by primitive tradition. The proof must,
I think, be sufficiently evident, from what has been and
will be adduced piecemeal and by way of contrast, in
the accounts of other and, for that period at least, more
important divinities.</p>

<h3><i>Venus.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Venus of Homer.</i></div>

<p>There is no deity, except perhaps Dionysus, of whom
the position and estimation in Homer are so vividly
contrasted with those, to which he or she attained in
later paganism, as Venus. The Venus of Virgil, the
Venus of Lucretius, are separated by an immeasurable
interval from the Aphrodite of Homer. And the manner
in which she is treated throughout the Iliad and
Odyssey is not only curious, as indicating the nature
and origin of her divinity, but is of very high interest
as illustrative of the great Poet’s tone of mind and
feeling.</p>

<p>There is no act of worship or reverence, no sign of
awe or deference, shown to her in any part of either of
the poems. Yet her rank is indisputably elevated. It is
beyond doubt that she belongs to the Olympian family.
She appears in Olympus, not as specially sent for, but
as entitled ordinarily to be there: she takes a side in
the war: she makes the birth of Æneas more glorious
on the mother’s side than that of Achilles, who was
sprung from Thetis, the daughter of Nereus, and a deity
of inferior dignity to hers. Not only is Jupiter her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
father, but her mother Dione is an Olympian goddess.
Yet her Olympian rank is ill sustained by powers and
prerogatives: and she probably owed it to the poetical
necessity, which obliged Homer to have an array of
divinities on each side in the war, with some semblance
of equality at least between the rival divisions.</p>

<p>The indications of the poem may lead us to believe
that her name and worship were of recent origin. That
a worship of her had begun is obvious: for in Paphos,
a town of Cyprus, and the only one named by Homer,
she had both an altar, and a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέμενος</span>, or dedicated
estate; and she bears the name of Cypris<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>. But we
have only the very slightest mention of her, or of any
thing connected with her, in Greece proper. We have
seen much reason to assume that Cyprus was essentially
Pelasgian, and ethnically more akin to Troy than
to Greece. In Troy we find various signs of her influence.
She sent to Andromache the marriage gift of
her <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρήδεμνον</span><a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>. She made to Paris the fatal present of
his lust<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>. She fell in love with Anchises, and became
the mother of Æneas<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>. She led Helen away from the
roof of Menelaus<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>, and was an object of dread to her
when in Troy<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>. Minerva, in taunting her bitterly
about her wound, supposes she may have got it by a
scratch from a golden buckle, in undressing some
Greek woman that she had persuaded to elope with
one of the Trojans whom she so signally loves<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>. Again,
it appears from a speech of Helen, that she was worshipped
in Phrygia and Mæonia<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>. The only token of
her influence in Greece is, that she is twice in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Odyssey called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κυθέρεια</span>. Thus we see her not strictly
within Greece, but rather advanced some steps on her
way to it. And it is easy to suppose that, in the race of
corruption, her worship would run among the fastest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Venus as yet scarcely Greek.</i></div>

<p>The negative evidence, then, thus far tends to the belief
that Venus was not yet established among the regular
deities of the Poet’s countrymen: and it is supported
by positive testimony. For some of the functions, that
must in the post-Homeric view of her office have belonged
to her, Homer studiously makes other provision.
Of this there is a most remarkable case in the Odyssey.
He designs that the Suitors, before they are put to
death, shall be made to yield of their substance to the
house of Ulysses, in the form of gifts to Penelope.
For this purpose he arrays her in all her charms, and
brings her forth in appearance like Diana, or golden
Venus<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>. It is not a common practice with Homer to
compare a beautiful Greek woman to Venus; especially
when it is one so matronlike as Penelope. On the
other hand, the comparison of Cassandra to Venus<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> is
entirely in keeping with the Asiatic character of the
deity. But the intention of the allusion here is manifest:
for when the Suitors see her, it is passion which
prompts them to vie with one another in courting her
favour through the medium of costly gifts. How, then,
came the sad Penelope thus to deck herself? It was
not her own thought: it was the suggestion of a deity,
and if Venus had been recognised by Homer as an
established object of worship in Greece, Venus would
most properly have made the suggestion: for she, says
Achilles, is supreme in beauty, as Minerva is in industry
and skill<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>. But it is Minerva who instils this suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
into the mind of Penelope; though in a form which conveys
no taint to her mind<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>. She goes, however, beyond
this: for she sends Penelope to sleep, and then,
to enhance her beauty, applies to her face a wash, of
the kind that Venus herself uses when she goes among
the Graces. Yet this is not procured from Venus, as
Juno in the Iliad procures the <i>cestus</i> from her on
Mount Olympus; nor is her agency or aid in any manner
employed. Thus she is not allowed, as it were, to
have to do in any manner with Penelope; a clear indication,
I think, that though known, she was not yet
worshipped in Greece proper.</p>

<p>She appears, indeed, in the legend of the daughters of
Pandareus<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>: but the scene of this legend is not stated
by Homer to be in Greece, and by general tradition
it is placed in Crete or in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Again, the predicaments in which she is exhibited
in the poems are of a kind hardly reconcilable with
the supposition, that she was an acknowledged Greek
deity at the time. In the lay of Demodocus, the Poet
seems to intend to make the guilty pair ridiculous,
from his sending them off, when released, so rapidly
and in silence. It is true that he exhibits to us in the
Iliad the sensual passion of Jupiter: but he has
wreathed the passage where it is described in imagery,
both of wonderful beauty, and rather more elaborate
than is his wont<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>. But whatever may be thought of
the Eighth Odyssey, the Fifth and Twenty-first Iliad
seem, so far as Venus is concerned, only to permit one
construction. In the former, she is, after being
wounded, both menaced and ridiculed by Diomed<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>.
In the latter, for no other offence than leading the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
battered Mars off the field, she is followed by Minerva,
and struck to the ground by a blow upon the breast. As
in the case of Mars, so and more decidedly in the case
of Venus, it appears as if the ignominious treatment in
the Theomachy was difficult, and the wounding and
treatment by Diomed quite impossible, to reconcile
with the idea that it could have been devised by a
Poet, and recited to audiences, for whom the personages
so handled formed a part of the established objects
of religious veneration. Even Helen is permitted
to taunt her bitterly: to recommend her becoming the
wife, or even the slave, of Paris, and her ceasing to
make pretensions to play the part of a deity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἧσο παρ’ αὐτὸν ἰοῦσα, θεῶν δ’ ἀπόεικε κελεύθου<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her advance from the East.</i></div>

<p>In entire harmony with these suppositions is, first,
the side taken by her in the war; and secondly, the
geographical indications of her worship. It appears to
have moved from the East along that double line, by
which we have found it probable that the Pelasgians
flowed into Europe: one the way of the islands at the
base of the Ægean, the other by the Hellespont. We
know, from other sources, that the East engendered at
a very early date creations of this kind. Under the
names of Astarte, Mylitta, Mitra, and the like, we seem
to encounter so many separate forms or versions of the
Greek Venus. We may indeed observe that Astarte
was commonly associated with the Moon, and it would
be a matter of interest to know the original relation
between the popular or promiscuous Venus (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάνδημος</span>),
and the celestial one. In Homer we find them completely
severed: we perceive Artemis with many traces
of the older, and Aphrodite fully representing the more
recent and carnal conception. There still remains one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
sign of correspondence; it is the standing epithet of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρυσέη</span> for Aphrodite, compared with the cluster of
golden epithets<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> applied to Diana. We may not
unreasonably, I think, take Artemis as the probable
prototype; and Aphrodite as the sensual image, into
which the old and pure conception had already degenerated,
before the time when the two fell, as poetic
material, each for its own purpose, into the moulding
hand of Homer. While such a source is every way
probable, our reference to it is the more natural,
because it is not very easy to attribute to the Greeks
of the heroic age the original conception of such a
divinity as Venus. For though they were of social
and therefore somewhat jovial habits, and though they
were a race of ready hand, given to crimes of violence,
yet they were not, on the whole, by any means a
sensual race, in relation to the standard which seems
to have governed the Asiatic nations, whether we estimate
these latter the Trojans, the Assyrians, or the
Jews.</p>

<p>The marriage with Vulcan, and the relation to a
mother Dione, invented apparently for the purpose of
maternity, are marks of recency. If I have rightly
referred Vulcan to the Phœnician order, this marriage
may be an indication that Venus likewise had a place
in it: and again, considering her station in Troas, it
seems not impossible that the worship of Vulcan may
have been introduced there the more readily, because
of his being reputed to be her husband.</p>

<p>Like Maias the mother of Mercury, Dione, the
mother of Venus, is excluded from the list of Jupiter’s
amorous or matrimonial connections in the Fourteenth
Iliad (312&ndash;28). This leads to the conclusion, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
that the tradition respecting her was known only as a
foreign one, or else that it was recent, slight, and as
yet unauthenticated in popular belief. In either view
it coincides with the other indications as to Venus.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Her rank and personal character.</i></div>

<p>The primary function of Venus, apart from Asia,
appears to lie among the Olympian deities. That she
was, as a member of that family, in actual exercise of
her prerogatives, we see plainly from the application
made by Juno to her in order to obtain the grace and
attractiveness, by which she hoped to act upon the
mind of Jupiter. As a mythological conception, she
exhibits to us on the page of Homer the union of the
most finished material beauty with strong sensuality,
and the entire absence of all traces of the ethical
element. She represents two things, form and passion;
the former refined, the latter not so. In her
character, as conceived by Homer, we see how that
which is divine, when it has ceased to be divine,
becomes, not human, but something much worse and
baser: as he that falls from a height cannot stop half-way
down the precipice at his will, but must reach
the ground. Even feminine tenderness does not cling
to the character of Venus. She is effeminate, indeed, for
when wounded she lets her son Æneas fall: but gentle
she is not, for in the scene of the Third Iliad with
Helen her conduct is harsh even to brutality, and she
drives the reluctant princess into sensuality only by
the cruel threat of violence and death<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>.</p>

<p>In Venus we see the power of an Immortal reduced
to its minimum. Even the faculty of self-transformation
seems to have been in her case but imperfectly
exercised<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>. She does not pretend to give strength or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
courage to her son Æneas, but is represented simply as
carrying him off in her arms. It is here worthy of
remark, that she has not even the ability, like the
greater deities, to envelop him in cloud: she has no
command over nature, only over the corrupt and rebellious
impulses of man: she has power to carry
Æneas away, but he is folded in her mantle<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>. In fact,
her privileges in general appear to be like those of the
inferior orders of deity, held and used for her own enjoyment;
but they do not carry the power of acting upon
man or nature, except in a particular and prescribed
function. Her capacity of locomotion is limited in a
peculiar degree. Mars, though no great deity, went,
when wounded, up to heaven on the clouds. But Venus
required to borrow the disengaged chariot of Mars for
the purpose, when in the same predicament<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that the ancient, probably the
earliest Greek, account of her origin which is given by
Hesiod<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>, should mark her as of entirely animal extraction.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity in the case of Venus is, that she
already takes her name, and not only receives mere
epithets, from two particular spots where she is worshipped.
Cyprus makes her <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κύπρις</span> in the Iliad, and
from Cythera she is also Cytherea in the Odyssey. She
thus stands distinct from Juno: to whom the Argeian
name is simply an appendage, though one of a most
characteristic force, and one involving important inferences
as to her origin. Nor is she less distinct from
Minerva, whose name is not derivative in form when
she is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀθήνη</span>, and whom we must consider as the
eponymist of Athens, and not its namesake. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
indication could be of greater force, than this marked
localism, in stamping the ideas about Venus as purely
human in their origin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Venus unable to confer beauty.</i></div>

<p>It would be an error to consider the Venus of
Homer as even the goddess of beauty. She was endowed
with it personally, and she possessed the <i>cestus</i> of fascination
and desire: but she had no capacity to make
mortals beautiful, such as Minerva exercised upon
Penelope and Ulysses, and Juno upon the virgin
daughters of Pandareus. She is there passed by in
such a manner as to make it plain that she did not
possess any power of imparting this gift. Her <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῶρα</span>, in
Il. iii. 65, do not appear to include it; or Paris would
not say, ‘no one would spontaneously seek them.’ For
beauty of person was among the recognised and highly
valued gifts of heaven<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>.</p>

<p>We are told, in the Twentieth Odyssey, that Venus
fed the orphan girls of Pandareus with cheese, honey,
and wine; and, continues the passage, Juno gave them
extraordinary beauty and prudence, Diana lofty stature,
Minerva industrial skill. Afterwards, they being thus
equipped, Venus went up to Olympus to pray Jupiter
that he would make arrangements for their marriage<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>.
Thus her operations in a work of good are wholly
ministerial and inferior: and not only does she not confer
beauty herself, but she sees it conferred by Juno. This
again shows that the Venus of Homer, except for evil,
has no power to work upon the body or mind of man.</p>

<p>But we must not omit to mark that sign of the real
chastity of Homer’s mind which he has given us by
his method of handling the character of Venus; a
deity whom the nature of his subject in the Iliad would
have led almost any other heathen, and many Christian,
poets to magnify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>In not a single instance does Homer exhibit this
divinity to us in an amiable or engaging light, or invest
her with the attractions of power, glory, and success.</p>

<p>When Minerva advises Diomed in the Fifth Iliad<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>,
she says, Do <i>not</i> attack any of the immortals; but if
you happen to see Venus, her you may wound. We
seem to have a clear indication, that Homer introduced
this passage simply in order to throw contempt on
Venus; because afterwards, when Mars is in the field,
and Diomed pleads the inhibition he had received as a
reason for his inaction, Minerva at once removes it,
and bids the warrior assail that god without scruple<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>.</p>

<p>Again, when Diomed wounds Mars, it is because
Minerva invisibly directs and impels his lance<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>: but
he wounds Venus without any aid. In the Theomachy,
she appears upon the list of deities enumerated as
taking the Greek and Trojan side respectively; but
when the Poet comes to match the others for fight,
she disappears from his mind; as though it would have
been an insult to any other member of the Olympian
family to be pitted against her effeminacy. Accordingly,
no antagonist is named for her.</p>

<p>She is sometimes made contemptible, as in the foregoing
instances. She is at other times silly and childish,
as under the bitter taunt of Minerva and the admonition
of Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>, and again, when she falls into the trap
cunningly laid by Juno<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>. Odious in the interview with
Helen in the Third Book, she is never better than
neutral, and never once so handled by the Poet as to
attract our sympathies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Never made attractive in Homer.</i></div>

<p>Again, there is not, throughout the Odyssey or Iliad,
a single description of the beauty of Venus, such as
Homer has given us of the dress of Juno, or the arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of Minerva. It is never, either directly or indirectly,
set off for the purpose of creating interest and favour.
One exception may perhaps be alleged: but, if it is such,
at least it affords the most marked illustration of the rule.
Once he does praise the exceeding beauteous neck, the
lovely breast, the sparkling eyes of Venus; but it is
when he has clothed her in the withered form of the
aged spinstress that had attended upon Helen from
Sparta, and through whose uninviting exterior such
glimpses of the latent shape of Venus are caught by
Helen as to enable her, but no one else, to recognise
the deity.</p>

<p>How different is this from the case of Virgil, who
has introduced a most beautiful and winning description
of her in the Second Æneid<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>, just when he brings
her into action that she may acquit both Helen and
Paris of all responsibility for the fall of Troy. It would
have been not only natural for Homer, but, unless he
was restrained by some strong reason, we may almost
say it would have been inevitable, that he should have
done for Venus what has been done in our own day, with
very high classical effect, by Tennyson in his Œnone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">Idalian Aphrodite beautiful,</div>
       <div class="verse">Fresh as the foam, new bathed in Paphian wells,</div>

       <div class="verse">Between the shadows of the vine-branches</div>
       <div class="verse">Floated the glowing sun-light as she moved.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Upon the whole, I should confidently cite the treatment
of Venus in the poems as being among the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
satisfactory indications of the state of heroic Greece,
and one of the most honourable tokens of the disposition
of her Poet.</p>

<h3><i>Vulcan.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Vulcan of Homer.</i></div>

<p>Besides Juno and Bacchus, Hephæstus or Vulcan is
the only Homeric deity who bears upon him this
unequivocal, or at least significant, mark of novelty,
that we are supplied with a distinct tradition of his
childhood<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>. In his youth he was rickety and lame.
His mother Juno wished to conceal him, and she let him
fall into the sea. Here Thetis and Eurynome received
him, and reared him in a submarine cave, not, however,
under the Mediterranean, but the Ocean; and in that
cave for nine years the boy-smith employed himself in
making ornaments for women.</p>

<p>He is thus associated by his traditions with the
two opposing elements of water and fire; with water
by the history of his childhood, and with fire as the
grand instrument and condition of his art. The latter
was by much the stronger association, for it was continually
fed by the history and progress of the art
itself; so that he became the impersonation of that
element itself, and in the phrase <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φλὸξ Ἡφαίστοιο</span> it is
his name which gives the distinctive force; for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φλὸξ</span> in
Homer seems to mean the flame or light of fire<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>, and is
not used to signify fire proper, except with some other
word in conjunction to it or near it. But the explanation
of the seeming contrariety is probably to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
in the hypothesis, that his worship was of Phœnician
introduction; as the Phœnicians seem to have made
the Greeks acquainted with the use of fire in working
metals. If they made the deity known to the Greeks,
this will account for his association with the idea of
fire: and as accounts and traditions, which they had
supplied, were evidently the source of all the more remote
maritime delineations of Homer, (since they alone
frequented Ocean and the distant seas,) this is the
natural and easy explanation for the tradition of his
childish arts in the oceanic cave. That he is thus, like
the Phœnicians, for Homer, the meeting point of fire
and water, appears clearly to stamp him as Phœnician
or oriental in his origin, relatively to Greece.</p>

<p>Accordingly, true to the association between Phœnician
and Hellenic elements, he is one of the five
Hellenizing deities in the Trojan war; in which, as the
element of fire, he opposes and subdues the river
Xanthus. He was not, however, unknown to the
Trojans; for Dares, his priest, had two sons in their
army. His introduction to Troas may have been due
to his conjugal connection with Venus; or it may have
been due to the neighbourhood of Lemnos, the island
on which, when hurled from Olympus by Jupiter, he
fell, and which thenceforward formed his favourite
earthly habitation. With Lemnos and other isles
Troy was in communication, at least from the time
of Laomedon, for that prince threatened to seize
Apollo and to sell him, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νήσων ἔπι τηλεδαπάων</span><a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>. A
regular commerce was established between Lemnos
and the camp during the Trojan war<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the deities of Vulcan’s generation we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
but one married couple, and they are a strangely
assorted pair, Vulcan himself and Venus. Neither
character nor occupation will account for this singular
union: on the contrary, there is no case in which the
extremes of repugnance must so decidedly be supposed.
It is questionable whether the hypothesis, that Venus
represents the beauty which gives perfection to works
of art, is in entire keeping with the tone of the Homeric
system. Indeed Venus with Homer represents absolutely
nothing, except sensual passion in a fine exterior
form which can hardly be severed from it. One explanation,
and one only, may suggest itself as more natural.
It is this: that the worship of Vulcan and that of Venus
came in, not distinctly connected with those of any
other deity, at about the same time, and from the same
quarter. We have already seen upon Venus those
marks of comparative modernism, and of an eastern
extraction, which we now find in Vulcan; and here
probably is to be found, either wholly or in part, the
actuating suggestion of their ill-starred wedlock.</p>

<p>Though we find the works of Vulcan scattered promiscuously
abroad, there is no notice of his worship,
or of any site or endowment belonging to him in the
Greece of Homer. He was available to the Poet for
embellishment, but he probably had not become for the
Greek nation a regular object of adoration.</p>

<p>I think we may trace the tokens of his eastern origin
in the legend of his infancy. It was into the sea that
he was thrown: but, as we have seen, the cave in
which he was reared was a cave of Ocean<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>
<p>Also, by a rather singular arrangement, there are two
deities, not one only, employed in taking him up and
watching over his childhood. Nor are the two naturally
associated together: for Thetis is a daughter of Nereus,
and belongs to the Thalassian family; Eurynome is a
child of Ocean. The connection with Thetis and the sea
is appropriate enough in the case of any child of Juno,
for the wife of Peleus, as his nurse, seems to give him
an Hellenic character: but it seems hard to explain
the appointment of a colleague belonging to the race
of Ocean, and for the situation of the cave in its bed,
except as having been due to the eastern origin of the
divinity, of which the mark had not yet been effaced.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His marriage with Venus.</i></div>

<p>The marriage of Venus and Vulcan, metaphysically
interpreted, represents the union of strength and skill
in the production of works of art: but though this
may have been a Greek application of eastern traditions
originally independent, there is no distinct trace of it in
Homer; while it may seem strange that, if the Poet
had had such an idea before his mind, his only picture of
their conjugal relation should have been the one given in
the Eighth Odyssey. Still, he may have had that idea.</p>

<p>Vulcan’s other wife, Charis, represents an exactly
similar conception; and here there is a more obvious
probability that the combination was Greek, and was
one intended, or even devised, by Homer.</p>

<p>It is common to treat the handling of this subject in
the Iliad as in contradiction with that of the Odyssey;
and to use the assumption of discrepancy either in
support of the doctrine of the Chorizontes, or in proof
that the Olympian lay of Demodocus is spurious.</p>

<p>Without entering into that controversy, I venture to
urge that the proof is insufficient. Why should the
Vulcan of Homer be limited to a single spouse?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Jupiter has three, probably four; namely, Juno, Latona,
Dione, and Ceres. No other Olympian deity, until we
come down to Vulcan, has any. The question then
arises, Why should the poets, or even the religion of
the day, be limited in this case to monogamy, which has
no place elsewhere in the Olympian family? Why should
the reasons, which induced the framers of the religion to
give him a wife at all, forbid them absolutely from giving
him more than one? Nay more; why, if the original
object of the Greek mind in this marriage was to
symbolize the union of manual skill and beauty, and if
the materials of the received mythology were in a state
of growth and progress, might it not happen that in the
youth of Homer Charis was, all things considered, suited
to afford the most appropriate means of representing the
idea, and yet that in his later age he might amend his
own plan, and make Venus the wife of Vulcan, without
at all troubling himself to consider what was to become
of the slightly sketched image that he had previously
presented in the Iliad? I say this, because the assumed
contradiction of these legends appears to me to proceed
upon another assumption of a false principle; namely,
that, though the mythology was continually changing
with the progress of the country, yet each poet was
bound, even in its secondary and in its most poetical
parts, to a rigid uniformity of statement. No one, I
think, who considers how the current of the really
theistic and religious ideas runs upon a very few of the
greater gods, can fail to see that with Homer the religious
meaning of his Vulcan, and of the other gods
of the second order, was very slight. A sufficient
proof of this may be found in the fact, that of no one
of them, excepting Mercury alone, does he mention the
actual worship in his own country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, two things may deserve remark with reference
to the variation which makes Charis the wife
of Vulcan in the Iliad, and Venus in the Odyssey.</p>

<p>First, from the plan of the Iliad, which placed Venus
and Vulcan in the sharpest opposition, the conjugal
relation between them would have been, for that poem,
inadmissible. The Poet could not have introduced
Venus, where he has introduced Charis: and he must
thus have given up a strikingly poetical picture, and one
most descriptive of the works of high art in metal.</p>

<p>Secondly, it may not be certain, but it is by no
means improbable, that the worship of Venus may
have attained to much wider vogue in Greece when
Homer composed the Odyssey, than at the period
when he gave birth to the Iliad. We have seen
already the signs that it was a recent worship. We
have seen it in Cyprus and then more advanced in
Cythera, not in continental Greece. Now it was in
the Iliad that Venus had the name of Cypris; in the
Odyssey this is exchanged for Cytherea: that is to say,
she was known sometime before as a goddess worshipped
in Cyprus and not properly Greek; but she was
now, such is the probable construction, known also as
a goddess worshipped in Cythera, and therefore become
Greek. On this account, as well as because the
opposition between them had disappeared, she might
with poetical propriety be made to bear a character in
the Odyssey, which could not attach to her during the
continuance of the great Trojan quarrel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Vulcan in and out of his art.</i></div>

<p>Beyond his own function as god of fire, and of metallic
art in connection with it, Vulcan is nobody. But
within it he is supreme, and no deity can rival him in
his own kind. His animated works of metal are
among the boldest figures of poetry. Even his lame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>ness
is propped by bronze damsels of his own manufacture.
And the lock, which he puts for Juno on her
chamber-door, is one that not even any other deity can
open<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>. But this is not so much an exemplification of
the power and elevation of mythological godhead, as of
the skill and exclusive capacity of a professional person
in his own art.</p>

<p>Finally, the Vulcan of Homer conforms in all respects
to the inventive, as opposed to the traditional
type of deity.</p>


<h3><i><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span>, or the Sun.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span> of Homer.</i></div>

<p>In the case of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span>, or the Sun, as in various
others, we appear to see the curious process by which
the Greek mythology was constructed, not only in its
finished result, but even during the several stages of its
progress. It lies before us like the honeycomb in the
glass beehive; and it tends strongly to the conclusion
that the Poet is himself the queen bee. The Philosopher
did not then exist. The Priest, we know, was not a
religious teacher. The Seer or Prophet interpreted the
Divine will only for the particular case, and did not rise
to generalization. Who was it, then, that gathered up
the thoughts and arrested the feelings of the general
mind, and that, reducing the crude material to form
and beauty, made it a mythology? The answer can
only be, that for the heroic age it was the Bard.</p>

<p>In some of the varying statements of the poems,
where others have seen the proof of varying authorship,
either for the whole or for particular parts, I cannot
but rather see the formative mind exercising its discretion
over a subject-matter where it was as yet supreme:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
namely, over that large class of objects which afforded
fitting clay for the hand of the artist, but which had
not yet become a stamped and recognised image for
popular veneration. In the Charis, who is the wife of
Hellenizing Vulcan, so long as Venus is at war with
the Greeks; in the Winds, who, according to the Odyssey,
inhabit a bag under the custody of a living person,
possibly a mortal, but who in the Iliad beget children,
enjoy banquets, and receive a <i>cultus</i>; we find Homer, as
I conceive, following the genial flow of his thought,
according as his subject prompted him, and awarding
honour and preferment, or withholding it, as occasion
served. Perhaps Mercury or Vulcan, perhaps even
Juno or Neptune, may owe him some advancement:
but, at any rate, he seems almost as distinctly to show
us <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span> in two different stages of manufacture, as a
sculptor shows a bust in his studio this month in the
clay, and next month in the marble.</p>

<p>In the Iliad we find the Sun personified, though in
the faintest manner, and by inference only. His office
of vision, which he enjoys habitually in the Odyssey,
and once in the Iliad<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>, is inseparably wedded to a
living intelligence by its combination with the function
of hearing. He is addressed as the</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">Ἠέλιός θ’, ὃς πάντ’ ἐφορᾷς καὶ πάντ’ ἐπακούεις.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now poetry may, under the shield of custom, make
the Sun see, by a figure which shall not carry the full
consequence of impersonation; but the representation,
that he also hears, seems necessarily to involve it.</p>

<p>Again, Jupiter has decreed, that Hector and the
Trojans shall prevail until the setting sun. After
that, there was to be no more of light or hope for
them. Juno desires on this account to close the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and dismisses the Sun prematurely to his rest. But this,
as the Poet adds, was done against his own will<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">Ἠέλιον δ’ ἀκάμαντα βοῶπις πότνια Ἥρη</div>
       <div class="verse">πέμψεν ἐπ’ Ὠκεανοῖο ῥοὰς ἀέκοντα νέεσθαι.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
</div></div></div>

<p>Upon the two words, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀέκοντα</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπακούεις</span>, rests, I
think, the whole case in the Iliad for the Sun’s personality.</p>

<p>But in the Odyssey it is more advanced and developed.
In the matter of the intrigue of Mars with Venus,
he acts as informer to the husband, and subsequently
assumes the part of spy<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>. Although thus able, however,
to discern what is passing even in the secret chambers
of Olympus, when set on guard for the purpose, he
cannot see so far as to Thrinacia, any more than he can
penetrate the cloud which envelopes Jupiter and Juno<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>.</p>

<p>It is from the Nymphs, Phaethusa and Lampetie,
whom he had set to watch, that he receives the intelligence
of the slaughter of his oxen by the companions
of Ulysses in their hunger. He immediately addresses
Jupiter and the assembled gods, in a passage which
proves that Homer meant to represent him as having a
place in Olympus, for only if there could he speak to
them without undertaking a journey for the purpose<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>.
He makes his appeal to them for retribution; and he
backs his application with the threat that, unless it is
granted, he will go down to the Shades, and shine there.
A menace which to our ears may sound ludicrous enough;
but it is perhaps well conceived in the case of a chrysalis
deity, not yet really worshipped by the Greeks:
and there is a certain propriety in it, when we recollect
that on the way to the descent into the Shades lay his
place of rest. He is the father of the Nymphs, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
watch on his behalf in Thrinacia; he is also the father
of Circe and Æetes, and his couch is at Ææa<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>.</p>

<p>During the time when the slaughter of the oxen is
effected, Ulysses is asleep: and it seems just possible
that Homer may by this circumstance have meant to
signify that it was night when the catastrophe occurred,
which would save the dignity of this deity in respect
to vision.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Is of the Olympian Court.</i></div>

<p>The Olympian rank of the Sun is clear; but there
seem to be ascriptions made to him, which can only be
reconciled by the supposition, in itself far from improbable,
that he was separately known of, as an object of
worship, through two different sets of traditions; one
of them referable to Pelasgian sources, and entailing
Trojan sympathies, the other of an Hellenic, or very
probably a Phœnician, cast, and tending to rank him
with the Hellenes. For in the Iliad his unwillingness
to set, when his setting was to bring the glories of the
Trojans to an end, seems very strongly to imply that
he had a Pelasgian origin. In the Odyssey, his siding
with Vulcan against Mars and Venus would show, so
far as it goes, a Hellenizing turn; but what is more important
is this, that, as the father of Circe and Æetes, of
whom the latter bears the exclusively Phœnician epithet
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀλοόφρων</span>, and the former has her abode close by
his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντολαὶ</span>, or point of rising, he is at once thrown
into the Phœnician or the Persian connection. As the
Sun-worship was so general in the East, it seems quite
possible that it might come into Greece by more channels
than one: and as the process of personification
might in one set of traditions be more, and in another
less complete, we may here find a possible clue to
Homer’s reason for treating it differently in the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
poems. Particularly as the poem where he is least
personal, the Iliad, is also that where he is most Pelasgian:
for we have found reason to ascribe to the Pelasgians
less of lively and creative power in the realms
of the imagination, than to the Hellenes, and to such
races as had stronger affinities with them.</p>

<p>So distinct is the Sun from Apollo in the Odyssey, that
they appear as separate <i>dramatis personæ</i> in the Lay of
Demodocus. Yet there are some latent signs of sympathy
between them. Apollo tends the oxen of Laomedon:
the Sun delights, morning and evening, in his
own oxen in Thrinacie. It is difficult to avoid supposing
some kind of relation to be conveyed by Homer
between the rays of the sun, and the arrows of Apollo
in the Plague. The extension of his sympathies to
both races is another sign of resemblance. Again, we
have a promise from Eurylochus, one of the crew of
Ulysses, to build a temple to the Sun upon his safe
return to Ithaca<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>. Now we have seen that the only
instances of temples, which we can certainly declare
to be named in the poems, are temples either of Minerva
or of Apollo. Thus this vow of Eurylochus looks
like another anticipation of the subsequent absorption
of the Sun into the person and deity of Apollo: and
on the whole, we are left to infer that beginnings of that
process may have been already visible. Homer, perhaps,
did not care to advance it. At least, it does not appear
to me that either he or his nation were friendly to the
conception of mere elemental gods. Gods who preside
over external nature he presents to us in abundance;
but gods, who are the mere organs of external nature,
are alien to the Greek genius as candidates for the
higher posts, and are relegated to subordinate places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
in the system. Only Vulcan and Ceres really appear
with him to bear decisively the stamp of this character:
and both of them seem as if they were already in part
detached from it, and developing in another direction.
For in Vulcan the human faculty of skill already predominates
over fire, and Ceres impersonates the vegetable
product of Earth, and not the mere dead mass.</p>

<p>The connection of the Sun with Pelasgian traditions
according to the Egyptian type is, I think, strongly
signified by the legend of the oxen and sheep, in which
he takes so much delight.</p>

<p>In the time of Homer he was, as it were, a probationer
in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγων</span> of the Grecian gods. The main facts
before us are simply these: first, his unformed separate
state at that epoch; secondly, his absorption in Apollo.
The lesson taught by both is the repugnance of the
Greeks to mere Nature-worship. The signification of
the second, in particular, appears to be this, that as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span> could not stand alone, and needed to be absorbed,
so he could find no place for his absorption so
fitting as in that deity, of whom, as well as of the more
venerable traditions that he represented, brightness
was an inseparable and original characteristic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His incorporation with Apollo.</i></div>

<p>In this view, the mythological absorption of the Sun
in Apollo is a most striking trait of the ancient mythology:
and it even recalls to mind that sublime
representation of the Prophet, ‘The sun shall be no
more thy light by day, neither for brightness shall the
moon give light unto thee; but the Lord shall be
unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>.’</p>

<h3><i>Dionysus or Bacchus.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Dionysus of Homer.</i></div>

<p>The Dionysus of Homer, or Bacchus, has all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
marks of a deity, whose name and worship were of recent
introduction into Greece, and were not yet fully
established there; while in connection with the Trojans
we have no notice of him whatever.</p>

<p>The eastern origin of this god seems in an unusual
degree to have been remembered in the later popular
tradition: and from the slight Homeric notices we may
find confirmation for the common idea; inasmuch as
the poems appear both to mark him as not originally
Greek nor Pelasgian, and likewise rather faintly to
connect him with the Phœnicians.</p>

<p>His father was Jupiter, and his mother Semele. Her
name occurs in a Catalogue, of which the first part is
composed of women, the second of goddesses; she
appears among the women. The lines, in which she is
mentioned may be rendered, ‘nor when (I was enamoured)
of Semele, nor (when) of Alcmene, in Thebes;
and Alcmene had stout-hearted Hercules for her son,
but Semele bore Dionysus, joy of men.’ These words
appear probably to mean that Semele, as well as
Alcmene, was in Thebes: and this supports the post-Homeric,
but ancient, tradition of the hymn to Bacchus<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>,
which makes Semele the daughter of Cadmus.
Now, Cadmus, according to every reasonable presumption,
was Phœnician. We have thus a fixed chronological
epoch, to which the god was junior. That is,
we have a period fixed, which may be called historical,
when his name and worship had not yet been brought
into Greece.</p>

<p>The only note that we possess of the worship of
Dionysus, as one established in Homer’s time among
the Greeks, is in the obscure allusion of the Eleventh
Odyssey to Ariadne<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>, who was put to death by Diana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
in the island of Dia, on her way from Crete to Athens,
at the instance of Dionysus, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διονύσου μαρτυρίῃσιν</span>. The
most probable interpretation of this passage seems to be,
that Theseus, when on his voyage, landed with Ariadne
in Dia to consummate the marriage, just as Paris<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>, on
his way from Sparta, landed in Cranae with Helen:
but that, since the island was dedicated to Dionysus,
this was punished as a desecration.</p>

<p>We thus see Dionysus taking root for the first time
upon the natural line of communication, namely that by
the islands, between Phœnicia and Greece: and his possession
of this island is in harmony with the tradition
of the Hymn, which represents him as having first been
seen upon the sea-shore<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Twenty-fourth Odyssey we are told that
Thetis supplied the Greeks with a gilded urn, in which
to store the ashes of Achilles, together with wine and
some unguent, probably fat. The passage to which
these verses belong is perhaps the least trustworthy in
the poems: nor is it in complete agreement with the
Iliad, which mentions fat only as used on the occasion.
But I refer to it because it is stated there, that this
urn was reported by Thetis to be the work of Vulcan,
and also to be the gift of Dionysus<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>. Her possession
of a gift from him is in harmony with Il. v. 136, which
represents her as having sheltered him, when, through
fear, he plunged into the sea: while his possession of a
work of art in metal is best explained by the supposition
that Homer regarded him as a Phœnician deity,
since it was from that race that such productions were
commonly, though we cannot say exclusively, derived.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand why, as the god of
wine and inebriety, Dionysus does not appear in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
theotechny of the Iliad; but it would seem that the
feasts of the dissolute Suitors in the Odyssey afforded a
series of occasions, upon any of which the mention of
his name would have been highly suitable. We may
perhaps even say that it could hardly have been omitted,
if his worship had been general and familiar in the
country. Again, Dionysus is nowhere mentioned in
connection with Olympus.</p>

<p>The remaining Homeric notice of this deity which is
also the most curious, sustains what has already been
advanced. The Arcadian king, Lycoorgus, scourged,
and pursued over the hill Nyseion, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μαινομένοιο
Διωνύσοιο τιθήνας</span>, the nurses of the frantic Bacchus;
they in dismay cast down their vine branches (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυσθλὰ</span>),
while he plunged into the sea, and Thetis gave him
refuge<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>. Jupiter, in retribution, struck Lycoorgus blind,
and cut short his days. Whatever explanation may be
adopted of its details, this legend seems to signify,
beyond all doubt, that some forty or fifty years before
the <i>Troica</i> (for Lycoorgus was contemporary with the
youth of Nestor<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>), the introduction of the drunken
worship of Bacchus was resisted by the Pelasgians of
Arcadia, and was for a time, at least, expelled by them.
The mention of Dionysus as a child probably imports a
further reference to the recency of his worship: and
there is something remarkable and significant in this
apparent commencement of violent opposition to it at
the point when women were beginning to be corrupted
by excess of liquor.</p>

<p>Even the later tradition of Hesiod, which makes
Dionysus the husband of Ariadne, by thus giving him a
Phœnician connection, so far sustains his Phœnician
origin<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>Dionysus is of the lowest inventive type.</i></div>

<p>As Dionysus is one of the most recent of the Homeric
deities, so likewise is he one of the most purely
heathenish<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>. He has not, even in Homer, a divine
maternity assigned to him, and he is the only one of the
Homeric deities who stands in this predicament<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>. The
anomaly was felt and provided for, in the later traditions
at least, by the deification of Semele after
death. But perhaps another mode of statement may
be adopted. As it is evident that the original tradition
made him the son of a woman, and as all those
with whom he is classed in Homer are probably historical
personages, it seems possible that he may have
been one of our own race, whose discovery or extension
of the use of wine may, by its rapid and powerful
effect upon the countries which it had reached, have
led to his adoption into the order of the Immortals, by
a process more rapid than took place in the case of
Hercules or any other person. Upon this supposition,
he stands altogether alone among the gods of Homer.
But, be this as it may, he is, when considered in the
capacity of a deity, the representation of an animal instinct
in its state of gross excess, and of nothing more.
He is the god of drunkenness, as Mars is the god of
violence, and Venus the goddess of lust: and there
are no three other deities, from whom Homer has so
remarkably withheld all signs of his reverence.</p>

<p>Though I state this as an historical possibility, I
think it is certain that, according to the Poet, Dionysus
was from his birth one of the Immortals: but it is also
very doubtful whether he was one, to whom a place
belonged in the smaller Olympian Assembly. Even in
later times, he was not one of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dii Majores</i>: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
his being the son of a mortal in Homer would tend to
make it probable that he was not invested by the Poet
with Olympian dignity. Again, he is only four times
mentioned in the whole of the poems; nor is a single
act of his manhood recorded, except his information
against Ariadne. That information seems to imply, that
a known Greek island was sacred to him; and it was
followed by the death of Ariadne under the darts of
Diana. These circumstances may perhaps raise a presumption
of his Olympian rank, equal to the adverse one
which has been stated above. So far as this inquiry is
concerned, the question must remain unsolved. But
little of interest can attach to these, the shameful parts
of the Greek mythology, which boast, as if it were our
strength, of what can scarcely be excused as our weakness,
and which treat our shame as our joy. The real
point of interest is to learn whether there was a time
when man, even though he had lost the clear view of the
guiding hand from above, yet revolted against, or had
not become familiar with, the deification of vicious passion.
And we seem to find the note of such a time in
Homer. Only one laudatory phrase is applied throughout
the poems to Dionysus; it is the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χάρμα βροτοῖσιν</span>,
and these words are not the sentiment of the Poet, or
of any character that represents his mind; they are put
into the mouth of Jupiter, when he is speaking under a
paroxysm of sensual passion.</p>

<p>I have not adverted to the tradition which places
the Lycoorgus of Il. vi. in Thrace, but have simply followed
what appears to be the suggestion of the
Homeric text.</p>

<i>The Composition of the Olympian Court: and the
Classification of the whole Supernatural
Order in Homer.</i></h2></div>

<p>In the full Olympian Assembly, or Great Chapter of
the Immortals, we find a collection of deities, who are
respectively the representatives, in the main, of Elemental
Powers, of Human Passions or Ideas, and of
Historical Traditions, either single or intermixed.
Among the simple examples, we may cite the Rivers
and Nymphs for the first, Mars and Venus for the
second, the goddess Themis for the third, Latona and
Iris for the last. In Jupiter, the chief of all, these elements
are blended together.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Principal cases of exclusion from Olympus.</i></div>

<p>But we must also consider those who do not appear
in Olympus, and why they are excluded. If, as is
perhaps the case, Aidoneus and Persephone are not
there, it is because of the separateness of their work,
and the remoteness of their kingdom. They had servants,
guards, and a judge, in short, a sort of polity of
their own. Atlas, Proteus, Calypso, Circe, and the other
purely local deities, so far as we know, are not there;
probably because they do not enter into the national
religion, but are little more than convenient symbols<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
geographical points known or conceived through maritime,
that is, without doubt, through Phœnician report.
Again, we do not hear in Olympus of Destiny, Sleep,
Night, Dream, Terror, Panic, Uproar, and the rest; probably
because these had not attained to practical impersonation
in the religion of the people, but were merely
objects of the poetical faculty. So likewise with respect
to the Winds, who stand as receivers of worship and
sacrifice in Il. xxiii. 195. The different treatment which
they receive in the Iliad and Odyssey, like their non-appearance
in the Great Chapter<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> of Olympus, unless
referable to the peculiarities of the Outer Geography,
shows that they had not a developed and established
godhead, but might be dealt with by the Poet at his
will. In these imperfect impersonations, it has been
well observed, sometimes the mere elemental power,
sometimes the superinduced personality prevails. Again,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄτη</span> the temptress, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span> the avengers, might
stand excluded, both on the same ground of inadequate
impersonation, and on other grounds. Nereus and the
purely elemental deities of the sea are not summoned
to the Assembly, apparently because he too had his own
submarine palace. It answered to Olympus; and here
he sat in state amidst his numerous Court of Nymphs.
Even Thetis was fetched from thence to attend the
last Assembly of the gods in the Twenty-Fourth Iliad.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ῥέα</span> are not in the divine meetings, firstly,
because he, probably with her as his reflected image,
is penally confined in Tartarus; but secondly, because,
the first representing Time, and the second Matter,
they are the primary ideas in the metaphysical order,
which comprehended all others, and from which all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
others were derivative. And as they stood in the
metaphysical <i>nexus</i> of ideas, so stood Oceanus and his
feminine, Tethys, in the terrestrial order; where Oceanus
was the all-inclosing, all-containing; the Form,
within which every terrestrial existence was cast, and
beyond which even Thought could not pass. Hence the
curious and marked exception of him from the summons
of Themis to the Great Assembly of the Twentieth
Book<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">οὔτε τις οὖν Ποταμῶν ἀπέην, νόσφ’ Ὠκεανοῖο,</div>
       <div class="verse">οὔτ’ ἄρα Νυμφάων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He is the father of the rivers, and the feeder of the
Sea. Even of the gods he is the ‘Genesis,’ perhaps as their
physical source, or as affording material for their formation;
perhaps as the outer band of that world to which
they belong, as much as we do, and outside of which
there was no attempt to conceive them as existing.
Lastly, it is perhaps because Homer meant to assign to
Oceanus and Tethys the actual first parentage of the
gods. This supposition is favoured by the fact that
Juno applies the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μήτηρ</span><a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> to Tethys, in a connection
which may make it equivalent to ‘<i>our</i> Mother
Tethys.’</p>

<p>It is clearly on a principle that Oceanus is not summoned
to Olympus, and not from mere defect or immaturity
of personality. For in conjunction with his
wife Tethys, he took over the infant Juno from Rhea,
at the time when there was trouble between Jupiter
and his father; and afterwards he reared the child in
his own domain. He can be lulled into slumber by
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὕπνος</span> like any other deity: he has a daughter, Eurynome<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>:
and he is capable of conjugal quarrels<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, Ocean is water, and Oceanus is the father of
all the Rivers: but yet he was not included in the
great lottery which divided the world between the
Kronid brothers. This shows us afresh, that he is
outside and independent of their rule: he forms the
framework of the visible creation, while they are parts
of the picture that is within the framework.</p>

<p>The same thing is true of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ῥέα</span> in the
metaphysical order. They represent anterior conditions
of thought and of existence to all other Beings, human
and divine. Their personality is established; but it is,
even more than that of Oceanus, in abeyance: for
Oceanus is at least ever-flowing, while Time, and Space,
or Matter, are with Homer wholly passionless, mute,
and still. When once the Kronid family has been
brought into existence, and the attempt of Time to
impose the law of death on Deity has been put down
by Jupiter, then the impersonations are virtually withdrawn
from him and his partner, and they relapse into
the torpid state of purely abstract ideas.</p>

<p>The Elemental Powers have nowhere what may be
called a strong position in Homer, except in the invocations
of solemn swearing; where they give force to
the Oath, because they are the avengers of perjury.
Thus their connection is not with deity in general, but
with that nether world, which the ideas of mankind
have always associated with the lower parts of the
Earth<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>.</p>

<p>Even on grounds larger than those derived from a
particular phrase, it may be probable, that we ought to
consider Oceanus as the Homeric parent of all the
deities, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ῥέα</span> included. To a state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
human mind not yet familiar with abstractions, Time
and Place, imperfectly conceived, might be more limited,
less comprehensive, than the great all-infolding
Ocean, which encircled and wrapped in the world.
And in this conception there may lie hid the embryo
of what afterwards grew into the aquarian cosmogony,
a system which appears not to be without support from
other passages of the poem, especially from the very
curious verse (Il. vii. 99),</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἀλλ’ ὑμεῖς μὲν πάντες ὕδωρ καὶ γαῖα γένοισθε.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>If, however, this idea was really in the mind of the
Poet, still we should consider it as having been with
him an instinct rather than a theory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dî majores</span> of the later tradition.</i></div>

<p>The Olympian deities of Pagan antiquity are commonly
represented as twelve in number; and the
names are</p>


<ul><li>1. Jupiter.</li>
<li>2. Juno.</li>
<li>3. Neptune.</li>
<li>4. Minerva, or Pallas Athene.</li>
<li>5. Phœbus Apollo.</li>
<li>6. Diana.</li>
<li>7. Mercury.</li>
<li>8. Histie, or Vesta.</li>
<li>9. Mars.</li>
<li>10. Venus.</li>
<li>11. Vulcan.</li>
<li>12. Ceres.</li>
</ul>

<p>But Homer knows nothing of this number or arrangement
of the gods; or of the distinction between
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dii majores</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dii minores</i>. Nor does he enable us
with precision to substitute any other number for it.
He gives us, however, his idea, at least by approximation,
of the number of the Olympian gods. For when
Thetis visits Vulcan, to obtain new armour for Achilles,
she finds the deity at work upon twenty <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίποδες</span><a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>,
to stand round the wall of the well-built hall, which he
is carefully fitting with wheels, in order that they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
automatically take their places in the assembly of the
gods. Whatever these <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίποδες</span> be, the number is
probably meant to correspond with that of the ordinary
Olympian meeting for festivity or deliberation. They
are commonly supposed to be bowls or vessels for wine
set on three-legged stands; but there are two reasons,
suggested by the language of the passage, which seem
to recommend our understanding the word to mean
seats, such as that of the priestess of Apollo at Delphi:
one is, their being intended to stand around the apartment,
along the wall: and the other is, that they were
to place themselves for the divine assembly<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὄφρα οἱ αὐτόματοι θεῖον δυσαίατ’ ἀγῶνα,</div>
       <div class="verse">ἠδ’ αὖτις πρὸς δῶμα νεοίατο.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This idea of the great bowls placing themselves, one
apparently for each deity to draw from, does not correspond
with the classical representation of the cupbearer
filling the cup of each, as he moves from the left
towards the right. Nor does the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγων</span> seem to
be suitable for a merely convivial meeting: and we
ought, I presume, to consider the meetings on Olympus
as in theory political councils for the government of
the world, only relieved by meat and drink. If we take
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίποδες</span> as signifying the seats, it has of course a
reference to the number of gods who constituted the
ordinary Olympian family; a reference which indeed it
may probably have, even if the other signification be
preferred.</p>

<p>And the text of the poems affords sufficient evidence,
that twenty was about the number of the
Olympian gods of Jupiter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Deities of Olympian rank in Homer.</i></div>

<p>Of the Olympian twelve recognised in later times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
all, except Vesta and Ceres, must at once and indubitably
be pronounced Olympian in Homer. For all take
part in the Trojan war, and likewise make their appearance
in Olympus. Thus we have ten Olympian deities
of Homer already ascertained. And there are several
others whom we can have no doubt in adding to the
list. These we will proceed to consider:</p>

<p>1. Latona is clearly Olympian; from her great dignity
as an unquestioned wife of Jupiter (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλοχος Διὸς</span>, Il. xxi.
499); and from the fact that her position entitled her to
take a side in the Trojan war, where none but Olympian
deities were engaged, with the single exception of the
formidable local power, Xanthus or Scamander. Another
reason is, because the title of Dione, as we shall
see, is clear; who is a deity in some respects similar,
but decidedly inferior, to Latona.</p>

<p>2. Dione the mother of Venus is in the same order.
For she receives her child, when she repairs wounded
to Olympus, and in her speech of consolation distinctly
describes herself as one of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὀλύμπια δώματ’ ἔχοντες</span>,
Il. v. 383. She is called in this passage <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῖα θεάων</span>: a
title twice given to Minerva, but also, sometimes, to
very secondary deities, such as Calypso and Circe.
Either as insignificant, or possibly as being foreign
and not sufficiently naturalized, she finds no place in
the Catalogue of Mothers in the Fourteenth Iliad.</p>

<p>3. Iris, the messenger-goddess. The grounds of
her title may be found among the remarks upon this
deity<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>.</p>

<p>4. Themis, although not a party in the war, has the
office of Pursuivant or Summoner to the Olympian
Assembly: and her ordinary presence there is distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
proved by the Fifteenth Iliad, where she is the first to
welcome Juno on her entrance into the circle.</p>

<p>5. It will be seen from a brief statement elsewhere
relating to Aidoneus or Aides, that he is clearly of
Olympian rank and character.</p>

<p>6. Next to Aidoneus, we may take the claim of Hebe.
She is not indeed an important, nor a very prominent,
person in the poems: but there is no room for doubt
as to her Olympian dignity. We find her officiating as
cupbearer in the Olympian Court of the Fourth Iliad.
Her connection with Olympus is further established by
her assisting Juno in the preparation of her chariot:
and by her assisting Mars in the bath, when that deity
has betaken himself into the presence of Jupiter, to
complain of his wound. Again, her personality is quite
clear. Nor can her divinity be questioned. She is
pronounced in the Eleventh Odyssey to be the daughter
of Jupiter and Here. The verse is suspected; but the
suspicion itself may be suspected in its turn. Further,
the case rests not on the particular account given of
her parentage, but, in connection with the context, on
her appearing as the wife of Hercules at all. Nor is she
anywhere connected with the idea of a mortal origin<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>.</p>

<p>7. A second divinity of somewhat similar rank is
Paieon. On two occasions, he heals in Olympus the
wounds of deities; first of Aidoneus, then of Mars.
He is summoned to the exercise of his function as a
person within call, and habitually present there. After
the rebuke of Jupiter to Mars, the line that follows
is<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὣς φάτο, καὶ Παιήον’ ἀνώγει ἰήσασθαι.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is no doubt therefore either of his personal, or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
his Olympian character; and none but divine persons are
capable of bearing the Olympian offices. Ganymede,
for instance, though carried up to dwell among the Immortals
in order to pour out wine, has no function
assigned to him in the poems. The Egyptians, indeed,
are stated to be of the race of Paieon<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>; but we must
probably understand this with respect to their royal
family, just as the same thing is said of the Phæacians
with respect to Neptune, because their kingly house
had sprung from him<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>. In the later mythology he
appears to be absorbed, like the Sun, in Apollo; but in
the Homeric poems there is no confusion, or approach
to confusion, of the persons. Paieon has the relation
to Apollo with respect to surgery or medicine, which
Vulcan has to Minerva with respect to manual art:
and, apparently by a mixture of distinct traditions, he
is also connected with Apollo, by being the synonyme
for the hymn of victory, of which Apollo is doubtless
supposed to be in a peculiar manner the giver.</p>

<p>To all these deities the poems appear to give a title
to seats in Olympus, unquestionable as well as direct.
By a somewhat less clear and simple process, we may,
I think, arrive at a similar conclusion as to the views
of Homer regarding two other deities.</p>

<p>8. The first of these is Demeter, or Ceres, whose
Olympian rank is considered, and I think established,
in the remarks elsewhere upon her individual divinity<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>.</p>

<p>9. The second is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span>, the Sun. His share in
the episode of Mars and Venus<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> does not indeed absolutely
imply his residing on Olympus. But this is
clearly involved in the account of his receiving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
intelligence, that his oxen had been consumed by the
companions of Ulysses. For, upon hearing it, he instantly
proceeds to address the company of the Immortals assembled
there<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>, and is answered by Jupiter. He must
therefore unquestionably stand as one of the Olympian
gods of Homer.</p>

<p>There are but three other personages named in
Homer, with respect to whom there is room for the
supposition, that he may have intended them to rank
as Olympian deities. They are Dionysus, Persephone,
and Eris. For Histie, or Vesta, is so entirely wanting
in personality, that she cannot possibly belong to that
order. She is invoked indeed in company with
Jupiter; but with these two is likewise combined the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξενίη τράπεζα</span>, the table of hospitality. In the hymn to
Venus<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> she has become fully personified, and is celebrated
as the eldest of the daughters of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span>. But this
imagery probably belongs to a different stage of Greek
society and Greek poetry.</p>

<p>1. 2. The case of Dionysus and that of Persephone,
very different, but both on this point doubtful, have
been stated elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Eris of Homer.</i></div>

<p>3. The case of Eris is different. She is the sister
and also the mistress of Mars<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>. And in the fierce
battle of the Eleventh Book, Eris alone is present to
enjoy it, while all the other deities, inhibited from
action by Jupiter, have betaken themselves to their
several abodes on Olympus.</p>

<p>Again, Jupiter sends her down to the camp at the
beginning of the Eleventh Iliad, where she stands on
the ship of Ulysses, and raises a mighty shout to stir up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the Greeks for the contest<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>. The word is, indeed, the
common and established word for strife in Homer, and
it is applied even to the conflict of the gods<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεῶν ἔριδι
ξυνιόντων</span>. But this use of it is probably to be compared
with that of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄρης</span> for a spear, and of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀφροδίτη</span> (in later
Greek) for the sensual function of that deity. She is, on
the whole, less a figure than a person, though standing
upon the border between the two respectively; and
though, as she never actually performs what may be called
a personal action, she is only by a few degrees removed
from the family of Terror, Din, Panic, and the rest.
The first of these, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Φόβος</span>, as he is the son of Mars<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>,
and attends him in fight against the Ephyri, is as distinctly
personified as Eris in one passage; but the effect
of it is neutralized by others, where he passes into sheer
figure. She rejoices in seeing the slaughter<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> wrought
in battle: and an intense eagerness is imputed to her<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>,
of course meaning an eagerness for blood.</p>

<p>But another form of this deity is probably exhibited
to us under another name, that of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πτολίπορθος
Ἐνύω</span>. Enuo is mentioned together with Pallas as being
a warlike deity, in contrast with the effeminate Venus<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>:
and she leads the Trojans to the fight in concert with
Mars: but while he has a huge spear in his hands, she
holds or leads, instead, another form more shadowy
than her own, that of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κύδοιμος</span> or Tumult. Yet the
mode in which she is joined with Pallas proves her
impersonation. The fundamental identity of her name
with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐνυάλιος</span>, the second name of Mars, and her joining
him in leading on the Trojans, place her in some
very close relation to him: and that close relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
cannot well be other than the twofold one of sister
and mistress, which had been assigned to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἔρις</span>.</p>

<p>When it is said, that ‘she alone of the gods was
present, as the others had retired to their respective
mansions on Olympus,’ the most natural inference certainly
is, that she too is meant to be described as belonging
to the Olympian Court.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, it seems pretty clear, that if the
Poet intended to limit absolutely the number of the
Olympian Court or Minor Assembly to the exact figure
twenty, then the choice for the twentieth place will
more justly fall on his Eris, than either his Dionysus,
or even his Persephone. It appears to me, however,
that so strict a numerical precision is not in the manner
of Homer; that he intended the twenty tripods to
be a general indication of the number of the Court, and
that with this indication the facts of the poems substantially,
though indeterminately, agree.</p>

<p>Such is the composition of the Olympian Court, or
smaller Assembly.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Classification of the Supernatural Order.</i></div>

<p>The Deities who, in virtue of belonging to that
Court, may be most properly called Olympian, may be
divided into the following classes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I. Deities having their basis, and the general outline
of their attributes and character, from tradition.</p>


<ul><li>1. Pallas Athene, or Minerva.</li>
<li>2. Phœbus Apollo.</li>
<li>3. Latona.</li>
<li>4. Iris.</li>
</ul>

<p>II. Deities of traditional basis, but with development
principally mythological or inventive.</p>


<ul><li>1. Jupiter.</li>
<li>2. Neptune.</li>
<li>3. Aidoneus, or Pluto.</li>
<li>4. Diana.</li>
<li>5. Persephone.*</li>
</ul>

<p>III. Deities of invention, or mythology proper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>


<ul><li>1. Juno.</li>
<li>2. Mars.</li>
<li>3. Mercury.</li>
<li>4. Vulcan.</li>
<li>5. Venus.</li>
<li>6. Demeter.</li>
<li>7. Themis.</li>
<li>8. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span>.</li>
<li>9. Paieon.</li>
<li>10. Dione.</li>
<li>11. Hebe.</li>
<li>12. Eris, or Enuo.*</li>
<li>13. Dionysus.*</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Those three names, which are marked with an asterisk,
appear to have only a more or less disputable title
to a seat in Olympus.</p>

<p>Outside, so to speak, of Olympus and its Court, we
may classify the superhuman intelligences of Homer
as follows: observing, however, that the minor deities
who represent natural powers, if thoroughly personified,
give their attendance in Olympus on high occasions,
and help to form its great Chapter or Parliament.</p>

<p>They may be thrown into the six following classes:</p>

<p>1. The greater impersonations of natural powers, and
of ideas; with their reflections, where such have been
formed, in the feminine. These are</p>

<p>Oceanus and Tethys.</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ῥέα</span>.</p>

<p>Ouranos and Gaia (not Earth, but rather Land).</p>

<p>Nereus and Amphitrite.</p>

<p>We are not authorized by Homer to associate either of
these last couples as husband and wife. We have to add:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Destiny, (which also has a place in the fifth class,)
Dream, Sleep, Death, Terror, Panic, Rumour,
Din, Uproar.</p></div>

<p>The process of impersonation is with some of these
fully developed, with others scarcely begun, and wholly
poetical; therefore as yet in no degree mythological. In
one place, Il. xiii. 299, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Φόβος</span> is the son of Mars, in another
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Φόβος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δεῖμος</span> are his horses (xiii. 119.); and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
in a third they appear along with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἔρις</span>, in a shape
hovering between personality and allegory. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἔρις</span> herself,
at times fully personified, in one passage is simply
a figure on the Ægis of Minerva, perhaps, however, as an
animated work of art, Il. v. 740. In all these cases we
see the work of poetical fabrication actually going on.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best example of a merely poetical, as
distinguished from a religious or practical impersonation,
is to be found in Æschylus, who makes Dust the
brother of Mud<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>.</p>

<p>This class was greatly augmented in the later Theogonies,
beginning with Hesiod.</p>

<p>2. The minor impersonations of natural powers, such as</p>


<ul><li>(1) The Winds.</li>
<li>(2) The Rivers.</li>
<li>(3) The Nymphs of meadows.</li>
<li>(4) The Nymphs of fountains.</li>
<li>(5) The Nymphs of groves.</li>
<li>(6) The Nymphs of hills.</li>
<li>(7) The Sea Nymphs.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. I place in a different class all those deities, who
appear in Homer as the subjects of foreign fable not
fully naturalized. These are they who dwell in the
Outer sphere of the marvellous Geography in the
Odyssey, and with whom Menelaus and Ulysses are
brought into contact. They are wholly exterior to the
system of Homer, and we cannot safely give them a
position implying any defined relation to it. But there
are certain links supplied by the Poet himself, as when
he makes Circe child of the Sun, and Mercury presumptively
nephew of Calypso: by these he shows us
the connection of the Greek mythology with Eastern
sources, and the partial assimilation of the materials
they supplied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>
<p>These deities are:</p>


<ul><li>1. Proteus.</li>
<li>2. Leucothee.</li>
<li>3. Æolus (perhaps).</li>
<li>4. The Sirens.</li>
<li>5. Calypso.</li>
<li>6. Atlas.</li>
<li>7. Circe.</li>
<li>8. Œetes.</li>
<li>9. Maias.</li>
<li>10. Perse.</li>
<li>11. Eidothee.</li>
<li>And several Nymphs<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Those impersonations which represent, each in its
several part, or its peculiar aspect, the tradition of the
Evil One, have been considered along with the deities
of tradition.</p>

<p>5. Of ministers of doom or justice, real or reputed,
and less than divine, yet belonging to the metaphysical
or moral order, we have in Homer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The Fates, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κῆρες</span>, who fall within the range of
ideas described by his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αἶσα</span> and his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μοῖρα</span>.</p>

<p>2. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἁρπυῖαι</span>.</p>

<p>3. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span>.</p></div>

<p>6. Besides all these, we have yet another class with
subdivisions of its own, composed of beings who stand
within the interval between Deity and Humanity.</p>

<p>There are some observations to be made on several
of these classes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Destiny or Fate in Homer.</i></div>

<p>It is much easier to obtain a just perception of the
manner in which Homer handles the subject of Destiny
or Fate, than to represent it in a system. The conflict
which it involves, either of ideas, or at least of the
words denoting them, was certain to give occasion
to argument and difference of opinion in a case where
a poet is of necessity called to take his trial at the
bar of philosophy<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θέσφατον</span>, on which I shall make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
remark hereafter, there are five forms of speech which
are employed by Homer to express the idea of Destiny;
they are, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κατακλῶθες, Κήρ, Μοῖρα, Μόρος</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αἶσα</span>: the
two last in the singular number only, the two preceding
it in the singular or plural, and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κατακλῶθες</span> only in
the plural.</p>

<p>Of these, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κῆρες</span> and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κατακλῶθες</span> have undergone
the most effective process of personification; but,
brought more distinctly into the sphere of life and
action, these phrases have a much less profound root in
the order of ideas, and scarcely touch the great questions,
whether destiny is a power separate from the
human will, separate from the Divine will, and superior
to either or to both.</p>

<p>The fundamental idea both of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μοῖρα</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αἶσα</span>,
traced from their original source, is not a part merely,
but rather a portion or share allotted according to some
rule or law. But, though of similar origin, some distinctions
obtain between the uses of the two words.
And first as to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αἶσα</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Under the form of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αἶσα</span>.</i></div>

<p>We have in Il. xviii. 327, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ληΐδος αἶσα</span>; in Od. xix. 24,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐλπίδος αἶσα</span>; in Il. ix. 378, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τίω δέ μιν ἐν καρὸς αἴσῃ</span>. In
all these cases it is plain, that the word means not a
mere part, but a part assigned upon some given principle.
Hence it comes to mean either the whole share
or lot assigned to a man, or the law according to which
it is assigned, that is, the law under which the moral
government of human life, and the distribution of good
and evil, are conducted. Accordingly, we have these
several senses in which it is employed.</p>

<p>1. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>, as the entire destiny, of an individual
man, Il. i. 416. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐπεί νύ τοι αἶσα μίνυνθά περ, οὔτι μάλα δήν</span>.</p>

<p>2. A notable part of that destiny, as his death:
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τῷ οἱ ἀπεμνήσαντο καὶ ἐν θανάτοιό περ αἴσῃ.</span> Il. xxiv. 428.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The moral law for the government of conduct, as
in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἕκτορ, ἐπεί με κατ’ αἶσαν ἐνίπαπες, οὐδ’ ὑπὲρ αἶσαν</span>.
Il. iii. 59.</p>

<p>4. That moral law as it is supposed to proceed from
Jupiter; the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διὸς αἶσα</span>, or dispensation of Jupiter; the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δαίμονος αἶσα</span>, or dispensation of Providence.</p>

<p>5. That same law, as it is supposed to proceed from
some other source, or to speak more correctly, for Homer,
as the power which administers it is separately personified.
This we have in the passage <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἅσσα οἱ Αἶσα γεινομένῳ
ἐπένησε λίνῳ, ὅτε μιν τέκε Μήτηρ</span>, Il. xx. 127; or,
again, as in Od. vii. 197; where <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αἶσα</span> is assisted in the
spinning process by the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κατακλῶθες βαρεῖαι</span>, as if it was
felt that she was not strong enough to make a Destiny.</p>

<p>Upon the whole it appears to me that there is in the
word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αἶσα</span> only the minutest savour of the proper idea
of Fate. For Fate involves these things: 1. a power
dominant over man: 2. a power independent of the divinity:
and 3. a power standing ideally apart from right.</p>

<p>Now <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span> does not fully answer even to the first
of these conceptions, since <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>, even when it is backed
by the gods, may be overcome by the energies of man.
Jupiter in the Iliad<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> ordained glory to Hector and
success to the Trojans until the sunset of the day when
the battle of the ships was fought: yet just before the
death of Patroclus the Greeks prevailed, Il. xvi. 780.</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">καὶ τότε δή ῥ’ ὑπὲρ αἶσαν Ἀχαιοὶ φέρτεροι ἦσαν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The only instances in which we find <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span> endowed
with any thing in the nature of an inexorable force are
such as that quoted from Il. xx. 127. In this passage it
is said by Juno, ‘We will give Achilles glory; thereafter
let him suffer what <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span> has appointed for him.’ Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
this refers not to a course of life that he was to pass
through, but simply to the crisis of his death. In Od. vii,
the speaker is Alcinous; and his sentiment is, ‘Let us
carry our guest safe home and then leave him to whatever
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span> and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατακλῶθες</span> have ordained for him.’
Probably this is only an euphemism, and means death,
as Juno meant it; but, in any case, proceeding from
another mortal, it is a mere form of speech perfectly
compatible in itself with the idea that the gods are
superior to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>, nay, that man may upon occasion
surmount it. In the other case it is not so; we must
understand Juno to recognise the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span> or dispensation
as absolute; but then it is the dispensation of death;
and it is, I think, the clear doctrine of the poems that
that dispensation cannot be cancelled or averted from
mortals, though there are various modes in which it
may be escaped or baffled: one of them, that of postponement,
which is temporary: another, that of translation
out of the mortal state, as in the case of Ganymede:
and a third, that of revival, as in the cases of
Castor and Pollux. To Minerva alone is ascribed a
power over death: and this seems to be a power of
subsequent rescue, and not one of absolute exemption.
Euryclea comforts Penelope with the exhortation to
pray to Minerva about Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>, as she can afterwards
deliver him;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἡ γάρ κέν μιν ἔπειτα ἐκ θανάτοιο σαώσαι.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The stress is evidently to be laid upon the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔπειτα</span>.</p>

<p>Another passage, which may at first sight present a
different appearance, will, I think, on examination, be
found to harmonize completely with what has been said.
When in the Sixteenth Iliad, Jupiter perceives that
his cherished son Sarpedon is about to meet his death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
by encountering Patroclus, he laments that it should
be the destiny of one to him the dearest of men, to be
slain by that warrior. Then he proceeds to consider
whether he shall remove him from the scene of danger,
though he was fated to die, or whether he shall subdue
him by the hands of Patroclus<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἢ ἤδη ὑπὸ χερσὶ Μενοιτιάδαο δαμάσσω.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus, in the space of a few lines, 1. he seems to recognise
destiny as a power superior to his own will;
then, 2. he debates whether he shall overrule this superior
power; and lastly, 3. he treats the execution of
its decree as the act of that very will of his. And on this
course, advised by Juno, he finally decides.</p>

<p>He desists from executing this plan, not because it
is impossible, but apparently for two reasons: the first,
that it may cause discontent and spleen among the
gods; the second, that by similar interferences, on behalf
each of his own child, they too may trouble the
order of nature. His power, therefore, to execute the
scheme is clearly implied. But what scheme? Not
one for repealing the law of death, so far as Sarpedon
is concerned<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>; but simply for adjourning the evil by
removing him to his home, and so putting him far
beyond the reach of the chances of the war.</p>

<p>When Vulcan is asked by Thetis to provide arms for
Achilles, he replies, Would that I could hide him from
his fated hour, even as I can and will provide him with
arms! Here, indeed, the expression is not to save, but
to hide him; yet even this is beyond his power:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">αἲ γάρ μιν θανάτοιο δυσηχέος ὧδε δυναίμην</div>
       <div class="verse">νόσφιν ἀποκρύψαι, ὅτε μιν μόρος αἰνὸς ἱκάνοι<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Vulcan indeed is a deity of limited powers; but in this
case he seems to express a general law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>Death inexorable to Fate or Deity.</i></div>

<p>The death, therefore, at some time within a given
space, of every person remaining in the state of a mortal
man, was a point settled and immovable, and so was
accordingly the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span> of death: but it was that the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>
was fixed, because death was fixed, and not that death
was fixed, because <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span> ordained it. We must distinguish
between a single incident of a mortal career, an
order which nothing can infringe, unchangeable but
uncaused, and the supposition of a power, which causes
that, and likewise all other parts of it, irrespective of
personal will, whether in the gods or in men.</p>

<p>It appears, I think, on the whole, that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span> has but
a limited and equivocal connection with the idea of
fate; it seems never to mean more than the fate of a
single individual, never to signify the large-handed
destiny that grasps nations and the world. It may be
overridden, as by the Greeks, after the battle of the
ships. And the reason of this seems to be that its
meaning has so strong a bias to the side of a moral law,
as opposed to a mere force. This comes out clearly in
the sense of the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἴσιμος</span>: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἴσιμα εἴδειν</span> is little less
or more, than to be a good man. Its predominating
sense is the ordained law of right; and as such, it is a
law very liable to be broken.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Destiny under the form of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μοῖρα</span>.</i></div>

<p>It is in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μοῖρα</span>, if anywhere, that we must seek for
destiny, in the sense which approximates to fatalistic
ideas. Here, far differently from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>, the moral idea
is subordinate in nearly all cases, and in some it is
wholly suppressed.</p>

<p>Like <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span>, properly means a portion or share,
a part accruing to some one under a law. Thus we
have <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐδ’ αἰδοῦς μοῖραν ἔχουσιν</span> Od. xx. 171; and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρώχηκεν
δὲ πλέων νὺξ τῶν δύο μοιράων, τριτάτη δ’ ἔτι μοῖρα
λέλειπται</span> (Il. x. 252). Thus it appears to pass into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
following senses, which may be usefully compared with
those of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>.</p>

<p>The scope of its meaning is far wider: it hardly stoops
to signify the destiny of a single man; Homer could
not well have said (see Il. i. 416.) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπεί νύ τοι μοῖρα μίνυνθά
περ</span>: although he can make <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span> as a power, appoint
a destiny <i>for</i> a man, (Il. xxiv. 209.) it is not the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span>
<i>of</i> a man. But it is</p>

<p>1. The appointing power as separate from any thing
else. It hovers between the state of an abstraction
and of a person: and it comes nearer to the latter than
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>. Not only have we <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα κραταιὴ γεινομένῳ ἐπένησε
λίνῳ</span>, (Il. xxiv. 209.) but especially,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">τλητὸν γὰρ Μοῖραι θυμὸν θέσαν ἀνθρώποισιν<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A passage by which, unless its effect were modified
from elsewhere, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖραι</span> seem in principle to take
the whole administration of moral government into
their hands, by fixing dispositions as well as outward
actions.</p>

<p>2. Besides being thus personal, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span> reaches to
mankind at large, and expresses a general law, in the
passage last quoted.</p>

<p>This may be a law of good fortune, as in Od. xx. 76<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">μοῖράν τ’ ἀμμοριήν τε καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>3. Or, with an epithet, it may mean ill fortune; as
in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα δυσώνυμος</span>, Il. xii. 116.</p>

<p>4. It seems very strongly to signify death, when used
simply, and without addition, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τεῒν δ’ ἐπὶ μοῖραν ἔθηκε</span>,
in Od. xi. 560.</p>

<p>5. Or when in apposition, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα θανάτοιο</span>, Od. ii. 100,
or again as in Il. iii. 101, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάνατος καὶ μοῖρα</span>.</p>

<p>6. Or any thing ordained for mankind at large, as
Od. xix. 592, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα ὕπνου</span>. You must sleep, says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Penelope; for the gods have so ordained it, (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ γάρ
τοι ἑκάστῳ μοῖραν ἔθηκαν ἀθάνατοι θνητοῖσιν ἐπὶ ζείδωρον
ἄρουραν</span>).</p>

<p>7. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μοῖρα</span>, like <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>, may be the embodied will, decree,
or dispensation of the gods. Thus we have <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα
θεοῦ</span>, Od. xi. 292, where <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</span> is either Jupiter or possibly
Apollo: and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα θεῶν</span>, Od. iii. 269, and xxii. 413. Now
the names <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ</span> seem to be higher with Homer
than any mythological name. They are his most solemn
forms for the expression of the idea of deity. Thus it is
remarkable that he never attaches <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span> directly to any
Olympian person. This testifies to its signifying something
larger than is conveyed by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>. But it also
seems to indicate that, even if it were capable of being
placed in antagonism to the will of one of the mythological
persons, into whose forms theistic ideas had
passed by degeneracy, yet it was not conceived as
opposite to or separate from the divine principle, but
rather as a power associated with it.</p>

<p>8. Though in general <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span> means the thing ordained
without reference to moral ideas, yet it is not always
so. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μόρσιμος</span> ordinarily means destined, while <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἴσιμος</span>
means right. But the ideas of right and might were
not yet wholly parted. In Od. xxii. 413 it is plain
that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα θεῶν</span>, pronounced by Ulysses over the
Suitors, contains a moral element: for he goes on to
say, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὔτινα γὰρ τίεσκον κ.τ.λ.</span>: and so Eurymachus, when
he means to acknowledge that the death of Antinous
was morally just, says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">νῦν δ’ ὁ μὲν ἐν μοίρῃ πέφαται<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The presence of the moral element in this word is entirely
adverse to the theory, that it was used in the
sense of fatalism. Power apart from a personal deity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
has been conceived by the human mind: but moral
power, I think, in such a state of severalty, has never
been made the subject of serious speculation.</p>

<p>9. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μοῖρα</span> has yet another sense, that of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοσμὸς</span>, order.
The force of the term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατὰ μοῖραν</span> is generally ‘with
propriety,’ while <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατ’ αἶσαν</span> is ‘with right.’</p>

<p>Thus in Il. xix. 256 the Greeks sit still, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατὰ μοῖραν</span>, in
order to hear Agamemnon: and we have an instance
of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατὰ μοῖραν</span> meaning ‘with propriety’ in Il. x. 169.
Here Nestor has been chidden by Diomed, not for a
moral offence, but for over-activity: and he replies,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε πάντα, φίλος, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He could not here have said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατ’ αἶσαν</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Under the form of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόρος</span>.</i></div>

<p>Lastly, we come to the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόρος</span>. There are
several shades of distinction between it and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span>.</p>

<p>1. It is never personified in Homer, nor even approaches
to impersonation.</p>

<p>2. It draws peculiarly to the dispensation of death,
in conformity with the law by which in Latin it became
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mors</i>. See Il. xviii. 465. xxi. 133: and, except
in this connection, it does not seem to be used to express
individual destiny.</p>

<p>3. Accordingly it is never associated with deity; in
conformity with the fixed character of the dispensation
of death. We have no <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόρος θεῶν, μόρος Διός</span>.</p>

<p>4. Yet this is not because <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόρος</span> is stronger than
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span>. On the contrary, we have no case in Homer of
a thing done <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπὲρ μοῖραν</span>, though it is sometimes apprehended.
Thus in Il. xx. 335 Neptune warns Æneas to
retire from before Achilles,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">μὴ καὶ ὑπὲρ μοῖραν δόμον Ἄϊδος εἰσαφικήαι.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόρος</span> receives the sense of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span> as the law of
right: a relationship curiously maintained in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mos</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">moris</i>,
compared with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mors</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mortis</i>. Men bring woe upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
themselves <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπέρμορον</span>, by obstinate wickedness: and the
crimes of Ægisthus (Od. i. 35.) have been committed
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπέρμορον</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>General view of the Homeric Destiny.</i></div>

<p>We thus see that, on the whole, the force of destiny,
as it appears in Homer, although it commonly prevails,
is not uniformly irresistible. We never find the deities
actually fighting against it, or it against them. So full
and large were Homer’s conceptions of the freedom of
the human will, that fate is sometimes on the point of
giving way before the energy of his heroes, and this even
when the strength of some god is brought in aid of it.
Thus Jupiter fears, lest <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπὲρ μόρον</span> Achilles should dash
the Trojan walls<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> to the ground. Apollo enters the
city<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>, lest the Greeks should take it <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπὲρ μόρον</span> on the
day of the battle with Hector. In the Second Book,
after the rush from the assembly, the Greeks would
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπέρμορα</span> have returned home, unless Juno had urged
Minerva to bestir herself by influence among them.
Many things are done contrary to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span>, or the ordained
law of right; whereas, although <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span> is not in the
abstract insurmountable, yet in fact it rarely is surmounted.
But then the Fate of Homer, the thing
spoken, is not in conflict with him that speaks it.</p>

<p>We do not find in Homer the curious distinction
which the speculative mind of the Greeks afterwards
worked out, between a fate representing the mere will
of the gods, and a fixed fate higher and stronger than
they:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">εἰ δὲ μὴ τεταγμένα</div>
       <div class="verse">Μοῖρα τὰν ἐκ θεῶν</div>
       <div class="verse">εἶργε μὴ πλέον φέρειν<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And again in Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὴν πεπρωμένην μοίρην ἀδύνατά
ἐστιν ἀποφυγέειν καὶ θεῷ</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>While this, on the one side, was the course of speculation,
the course of poetic thought was towards a complete
impersonation of Destiny in the three Fates, representing
an image so congenial, as a poetic image
only, to the human mind, that it found its way into the
romance poetry of Christian Italy.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, it appears at any rate most probable,
that Homer had not formed the conception of a
law extrinsic to all volition human and divine, and so
powerful as to override it.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be conceived that Homer would have
treated a successful resistance to the laws of Destiny
as lying within the possible reach of mankind, had he
deemed it to be a power independent of, and superior
to, the Divine Will; because he always represents the
latter as decisive and supreme over human fortunes.</p>

<p>I think that the primary ideas conveyed in the
terms <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fatum</span> will not be found, when examined,
to agree. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fatum</i> is the decree without reason;
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic volo sic jubeo</i>; and the idea of it is the result
of the long, wearisome, despairing experience of bewildered
man, after the world has lost the freshness
and the joy of its childhood. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span>, or share, is a
distribution made according to a law or moral purpose:
it cannot, without parting from its nature, be blind:
its tendency in Homer rather is, as we see in Il. xxiv.
49, to grow into a sort of rival Providence.</p>

<p>The arguments to an opposite effect are surely inconclusive<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>.
The question raised by the Scales of
Jupiter is, not what the springs may be which determine
the movement of the world, but simply what is
his foreknowledge of the direction it will take. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
representations would be perfectly consistent with belief
in the supremacy (so to speak) of Chance: and
while we may admit that, inasmuch as they are not produced
for the information of men, they must indicate a
limitation in Jupiter, we should not mistake the nature
of that limitation.</p>

<p>Again, we must not suppose that because some particular
deity deplores the course of destiny, therefore
that course is in opposition to the general deliberation
and decision of Olympus.</p>

<p>And when, as is commonly the case, we find the
deities cooperating with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span>, the assumption that
they are its servants, seems to be wholly unwarranted.
It seems much more natural to suppose that the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span>,
to which they are giving effect, is simply the divine
will: especially as, though we find single gods, Neptune
or Apollo, for example, cooperating with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span>, I doubt
whether this is ever represented of the gods at large
and their supreme decrees.</p>

<p>In order to solve the general question, what after
all can be more reasonable than to look to the main
action of the poems, and inquire what power or what
counsel it is which takes effect through the medium of
their machinery as a whole? If this be the test, there
is no room for doubt upon the issue. In the Iliad it is
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διὸς βουλὴ</span> (Il. i. 5): the determination of Olympus,
into which Jupiter had wisely allowed his own opposite
inclinations to merge. In the Odyssey<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>, it is the decision
of the same tribunal, at the instance of Minerva,
and with Neptune alone dissentient. Upon the whole,
for the poems and the day of Homer, I cannot but
think that both the supremacy of godhead as a whole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and the freedom of man remain, if somewhat darkened,
yet certainly unsubverted. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span> of Homer may, it
is probable, be no more and no less in the main than that
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θέσφατον</span>, or divinely uttered decree, which he sometimes
uses in such a manner as to admit of the supposition
that they were really synonymous.</p>

<p>At the same time we do not find, nor could we expect
to find, in Homer any clear assertion of the
majesty of the true Divine Will, as the mainspring that
moves the universe. That is emphatically a Christian
sentiment, which is conveyed in the lofty formula of
Dante:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
       <div class="verse">Così si vuol colà, dove si puote</div>
       <div class="verse">Ciò che si vuole.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">So is it willed above, where He, that wills,</div>
       <div class="verse">Can what he wills.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Fate of Homer may indeed logically embrace a
germ, which will afterwards expand into the idea of a
power extrinsic to Deity, and able to overrule it. We
may argue to show that the representation, perseveringly
developed, means as much as this. But then such representations
in Homer are not perseveringly, much less
are they unilaterally, developed. They have not been
thought through even to their legitimate consequences,
and far less to those which appear to arise from the following
out, not of a full truth, but of some particular
and severed aspect of it. Taken at the worst, Destiny in
Homer broods like a cloud in a distant quarter of the
sky, silently gathering the might which, when ripe, is to
engage in obstinate and unending conflict with deity.
But for this work the material is not yet prepared;
and practically neither <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοῖρα</span> nor <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἶσα</span> much crosses the
work of Divine government, such as it is conceived and
exhibited in Homer. I pass on to the second Class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Minor impersonations from Nature.</i></div>

<p>Among the Greeks, and even in Homer, every tree,
every fountain, all things inanimate, that either vegetated
or moved, had their indwelling deity. Homer,
however, represents the infancy of that system, and
though he impersonates many other local agencies, he
gives to none so active a personality as to Rivers.
Ulysses in his distress addresses the god of the Scherian
river<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>; and is answered by the staying of the current.
Simois is addressed personally by Xanthus<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>;
and Xanthus himself, by virtue of his local power, is
promoted to the honour of contending with Vulcan, the
god of fire, a member of the Olympian Court, and a
son of Jupiter and Juno. So the Spercheus<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> is invoked,
and, what is more, invoked so far off as in Troas,
by Achilles.</p>

<p>The perpetual movement which inheres in the essence
of a river, combined with the visibility which
separates it from mere atmospherical currents, seems
to connect it more closely than any other natural object
with the idea of life. It is most interesting to
observe how the sentiment here expressed seems to
have worked in ages widely distant, upon great poets
of differing nations, temperaments, and circumstances,
after their differing manners. Homer does not impute
feelings to a River; but he impersonates it with
a treatment different to that which he applies to
groves, fountain, or meadow. Now these personifications
though not yet disused (especially in the English
poetry of the last century), have become far less real and
effective for the human mind, since the Gospel opened
to us the unseen world with its crowd of ethereal inhabitants.
Observe, accordingly, how a feeling identical
with that of Homer, a tendency to invest outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
nature with vitality and action, in these more recent
times takes a different form. The great Dante, more
than two thousand years later in the line of human descent,
without personifying, yet ascribes feeling to a
river; he imagines the Po, after its tumultuous headlong
descent with all its feeders from the mountains,
longing for peace, and seeking it by repairing to the
sea. Francesca da Rimini thus describes her birth-place;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
       <div class="verse">Siede la Terra, dove nata fui,</div>
       <div class="verse">Sulla marina, dove ’l Po discende</div>
       <div class="verse">Per aver pace co’ seguaci sui.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And one of lesser indeed, (for who is not less than
such as these?) but yet of both high and honoured
poetic name, our own Wordsworth, in his Sonnet<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> on
the River Thames, seen from London Bridge at sunrise,
has the well known line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">The river wanders at his own sweet will.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He may also be claimed as a witness to what has
been said of the truth and power of these personifications
to the ancients. For in another noble Sonnet,
where he complains of the deadening power and
weight of worldly life, and intends to show that a
system of shadows, when men really appropriate and
digest the truth it has, is better for them than to have
a system of substances around them, and yet to remain
unpenetrated by it, he describes that system of shadows
by recalling two of its vivid personifications<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>.</p>

<p>But while Homer brings into action no personifications
of this class, except those of Rivers, he peoples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
each with its appropriate Genius, the fountains, the
grassy meadows, and the groves. In the Great Parliament
of the supernal world at the beginning of the
Twentieth Iliad, all are represented. Even here, however,
the distinction is preserved: the Rivers attend
as it were in person; but the rest by deputy, that is,
by their proper indwelling and presiding Spirits;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">οὔτε τις οὖν Ποταμῶν ἀπέην νόσφ’ Ὠκεανοῖο,</div>

<p>Thus the first are impersonations: the second only
residences for persons to dwell in.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Harpies of Homer.</i></div>

<p>The Harpies, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἁρπυῖαι</span>, of Homer have been, I think,
truly described as ‘nothing but personified storm-winds<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>.’
They have no connection, when jointly viewed,
with the moral order, except that they may, as mere
carriers, take a subordinate part in the fulfilment of a
moral purpose, which is quite as true of the Winds,
personified or unpersonified. The Harpy <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ποδάργη</span> is
personified individually, as the mother who bears to
Zephyr the two deathless horses of Achilles, Xanthus
and Balius<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>; but apparently for no other purpose than
one purely relative. The classical passage respecting
the Harpies is that in Od. xx. 61&ndash;79, which forms a
part of the prayer of Penelope to Diana. The object
of the matron’s petition is that, wearied out with her
sorrows, she may die, and this in one of two modes:
either by the arrows of the goddess; or else, that a hurricane
may seize her, and, driving her along the paths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of air, deposit her in the channels of Ocean, that is to
say, the place of the dead. Then she proceeds to illustrate
this last mode of death, of which she has named
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύελλα</span> as the instrument, by the tale of the daughters
of Pandareus, who, having lost their parents, were in an
extraordinary manner petted by the goddesses. Aphrodite
fed them, Here gave them sense and beauty,
Artemis stature, Pallas endowed them with skill.
And, lastly, Aphrodite went to Olympus to induce
Jupiter to provide for their marriage. But while she
was away on this errand, the Harpies carried off these
maidens, and gave them to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες, ἀμφιπολεύειν</span>, to
be their servants, as it is sometimes rendered, but, as I
should venture to construe it, ‘for them, i. e. the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span>, to deal with.’ It is evident that, in this curious
legend, the Harpies are introduced to exemplify nothing
more than the part which Penelope had previously referred
to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύελλα</span>; and these powers, who represent
Hurricane or Squall, and in whose agency lies the gist
of the story, appear to have been in this matter the
ministers of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span>, beings of a very different order.
These beings are evidently introduced, though entirely
beyond the parallel of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύελλα</span>, in order to complete
the moral. The only other case in which Homer introduces
the Harpies is in a line, twice repeated, where
Penelope supposes that they may have carried Ulysses
off (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκλειῶς</span>) ingloriously<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>, i. e. so as to rob him in death
of his due meed of fame. And this Friedreich well
compares with part of a passage in the Book of Job,
which is as follows, chap. xxvii. 20, 21. ‘A tempest
stealeth him away in the night: the east wind carrieth
him away, and he departeth; and as a storm hurleth
him out of his place.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>The Erinues of Homer.</i></div>

<p>The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span> are of much greater importance; and
their position deserves the more careful inquiry, because
it has, I think, been often misunderstood, perhaps
from being appreciated only through the delusive medium
of the later tradition, which appears to me to
have let drop all the finer elements of the conception,
by a process similar to that which it effected upon
the great Homeric characters of Achilles, Helen, and
Ulysses.</p>

<p>It is quite insufficient to say of these personages, by
way of description, that they are the avengers of
crime<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>, or that they grudge the bliss of mortals, or that
they defend the authority of parents<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>: and it is wholly
erroneous, in my opinion, to treat them as ‘originally
nothing but a personification of curses pronounced upon
a guilty criminal<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>.’</p>

<p>Let us first collect the facts respecting their position
in Homer.</p>

<p>1. In the narrative of Phœnix we find that when, at
the instigation of his mother, he had sought the embraces
of a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παλλακὶς</span>, for whom his father had a passion,
the father, incensed, invoked the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span> to make him
childless. ‘This curse,’ he says, ‘the gods (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ</span>) accomplished,
and the subterranean Jupiter, and awful
Persephone,’ Il. ix. 449&ndash;57.</p>


<p>2. The mother of Meleager, on account of his having
slaughtered her brother, invoked Aïdes and Persephone,
beseeching them to slay that hero: whereupon
the Erinūs, here called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠεροφοῖτις</span>, ‘that walketh in
darkness,’ heard her from Erebus, and the city was
besieged. But here the Erinūs appears to act, if not
wholly in favour of Meleager, yet against his mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
The city is assaulted, forced, and set on fire. The family,
including the mother who had cursed him, entreat
Meleager to deliver them, and attempt to attract his
favour by splendid promises of a demesne, to be conferred
on him by the public. Only when the palace
itself is assailed does he consent. He repels the enemy;
the demesne is not given him: and, on account of his
thus relenting only at the last moment, Phœnix quotes
him as a warning example, for Achilles to avoid. (Il. ix.
565&ndash;603.)</p>

<p>3. In Il. xv. 204, when Neptune seems inclined to
be refractory, Iris reminds him that the Erinūs will act
with Jupiter, because he is the elder brother:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">οἶσθ’, ὡς πρεσβυτέροισιν Ἐρινύες αἰὲν ἕπονται.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And upon this hint Neptune at once alters his tone,
allows that she has spoken <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατὰ μοῖραν</span>, and complies
with the command that she has brought.</p>

<p>4. In Il. xix. Agamemnon, while he admits his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη</span>,
(v. 87), throws, we might say shuffles off, the blame of
it upon Jupiter, Destiny, and Erinūs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent22">ἐγὼ δ’ οὐκ αἴτιός εἰμι,</div>
       <div class="verse">ἀλλὰ Ζεὺς καὶ Μοῖρα καὶ ἠεροφοῖτις Ἐρινύς.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>5. In vv. 258&ndash;60 of the same Book, the same personage
invokes as witnesses to his asseveration concerning
Briseis, 1. Jupiter, 2. the Earth, 3. the Sun,
4. the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span>, ‘who dwell beneath the earth, and
punish the perjured.’</p>

<p>6. In v. 418 of the same Book, after the horse Xanthus,
receiving a voice by the gift of Juno, has given
to Achilles a dark indication of his coming fate, the
Erinues interfere to prevent any further disclosures:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὣς ἄρα φωνήσαντος Ἐρινύες ἔσχεθον αὐδήν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>7. When, in the Theomachy, Minerva has laid Mars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
prostrate by a blow, she taunts him by telling him he
may in his overthrow recognise the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span> of his
mother Juno, invoked upon him for having changed
sides in the contest (Il. xxi. 410&ndash;14).</p>

<p>8. In the Odyssey (ii. 135), Telemachus apprehends
that, if he dismisses his mother, he will have to encounter,
among other evils, the Erinuës whom she will
invoke upon him.</p>

<p>9. Epicaste, the mother of Œdipus, is speedily removed
from the face of earth for her hapless incest.
Œdipus himself lives and reigns: but suffers many
sorrows, which the Erinuës of Epicaste (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μητρὸς Ἐρινύες</span>,
as in Il. xx. 412) bring upon him.</p>

<p>10. Melampus, a rich subject of Neleus in Pylos, is
imprisoned for a whole year in the house of Phylacus,
and has his property seized or confiscated, on account
of the daughter of Neleus, and of his grievous <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη</span>,
which the goddess, the hard-striking<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Erinūs, brought
into his mind (Od. xv. 233):</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">εἵνεκα Νηλῆος κούρης, ἄτης τε βαρείης,</div>
       <div class="verse">τήν οἱ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεὰ δασπλῆτις Ἐρινύς.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But he escaped from death, and paid, i.e. accomplished,
the strange act that Neleus had imposed as the condition
of obtaining the command over his daughter’s
hand. He thus procured it for his brother, termed in
the post-Homeric tradition Bias. This condition was,
that he should bring off to Pylos the cows which were
the property of Iphicles (and apparently of Phylacus).
He was caught at Phylace in the attempt: but after a
year Iphicles released him, apparently in consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of benefit derived from his prophetic knowledge, Od.
xv. 228&ndash;38, and xi. 287&ndash;97.</p>

<p>11. In Od. xvii. 475, 6, Ulysses, when Antinous had
hurled the stool at him, invokes upon that Suitor in
return the anger of the gods and Erinuës (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴ πού γε
εἰσὶν</span>, if such there be) of the poor.</p>

<p>12. Lastly, in Od. xx. 78, as we have seen, the
Harpies deliver the daughter of Pandareus into the
hands of the Erinuës.</p>

<p>We have thus a very copious supply of information
from Homer, in no less than twelve passages, every
one of which represents the action of these singular
beings in a fresh and varied light: and the question is,
what is the one common idea, which is sufficiently
comprehensive to include them all, and is also in harmony
with the purport of each?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Vindicators of the moral order.</i></div>

<p>I answer, that the Erinuës are, in the Homeric
system, the never-failing champions, because they are
the practical avengers, of the natural and moral order,
at all times, under all circumstances, and against all
persons whatsoever. They have nothing to do with the
prevention of crime: but they appear to be the principal
instruments for its punishment, especially here, but
likewise hereafter. This, however, is only a part of
their function. They are the sworn servants of a fixed
order of the universe, apart from, anterior to, and independent
of, all volition, divine or human: and they
avenge the infraction of that order, not merely as a law
of right opposed to wrong, but as a law of order opposed
to disorder; they are goddesses themselves, but they
are wholly apart from the Olympian dispensation, sometimes
put in conjunction with deities of the mythology,
sometimes apart from, sometimes in opposition to
them. They are, in short, an early and poetical ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>pression
of that philosophy, which even in Christian
times has seemed to seek a foundation for the supreme
laws more or less dissociated from, and wholly exterior
to, the Divine Will: the philosophy, not of Destiny,
but of the ‘Immutable Morality’ of Cudworth and his
school: the philosophy harmonizing with the Ideas of
the Platonists: the philosophy of which we have a distant
glimpse in the words of St. Bernard, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incommutabile
est, quod ne ipsi quidem Deo mutare liberum est</i><a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>: and
which Butler has presented to us in the mild forms of
his admirably balanced wisdom.</p>

<p>I will take first, as the criteria of this proposition,
the remarkable cases in which we find the Erinuës of
Homer in qualified conflict with Deity. It is commonly
held, that in the Nineteenth Iliad the Erinuës
interfere to prevent Xanthus from telling too much to
Achilles. No doubt Homer effects this purpose by
their means: but they never interfere with the aim of
prevention. It is the natural order which had been
broken by the act of Juno in conferring the gift of
speech upon a horse, and which they by their interposition
mean to vindicate and reestablish.</p>

<p>They play the same part in the case of the daughters
of Pandareus. It is plain that the goddesses of Olympus
had vied with one another, after an unprecedented
and abnormal manner, in loading these damsels with an
extraordinary accumulation of gifts. Everything, even
food, came to them by the direct and immediate agency
of their Immortal handmaids: and at last Jupiter was
actually besought to find them husbands. All this lay
far beyond, and was therefore in derogation of the ordinary
laws for the government of the world: it left no
space for human volition, effort, or discipline: it thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
struck at the root of the moral order; and on this ground
the Erinuës interfere, apparently employing the Hurricanes
as their agents, to remove these maidens from
the earth, and to deposit them upon the Ocean stream,
by the place of the dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their operation upon the Immortals.</i></div>

<p>I do not know whether, over and above the infraction
of natural order which I have mentioned, there
may not have been another cause for their intervention
in the special manner in which the endowments had been
conveyed: for where we find Juno granting to them
‘beauty and sense beyond all other women<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>,’ it appears
as if she had travelled into the province not only of
Venus, but of the great Minerva, with whose prerogatives
I doubt whether we ever find any similar interference
allowed by Homer. It is therefore just possible
that the Erinuës may here interpose on behalf of the
laws and arrangements of Olympus, as well as of those
belonging to Earth.</p>

<p>The explanation which I have proposed will entirely
fit the warning of Iris to Neptune. The natural order,
which assigns the prerogatives of government to the
elder, in other words, the right of primogeniture, is a
rule for the Immortals, as well as for mankind, since it
is taken to be founded upon a basis more profound than
will, which was not, and could hardly be for Homer,
even when divine, either the source or the master of
creation. But while the Erinuës are thus on the side
of Jupiter, and while the recollection of them at once
induces Neptune to succumb, they are not on that account
in any sense or degree his ministers.</p>

<p>On the same side with him we find them, where they
are invoked by Ulysses, as the Erinuës, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the gods, of the poor: or as when Agamemnon lays
upon Erinūs, along with Jupiter and Destiny, the blame
of errors, for which notwithstanding the Greeks rightly
held him<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>, and even he could not deny himself to be,
responsible. Yet we are never told that the Erinuës
move at the bidding of Jupiter, or of any other Olympian
deity. Here we seem to have a glimpse into the
deeper truths of the heroic age. Theology had already
wandered from its orbit: it was fast losing all the
severity and majesty of truth; but the deep roots
which God had given to the sense of responsibility,
and the expectation of retribution, in the human mind,
had not yet been wholly plucked up; and Homer’s fine
sense of truth forbade him to connect the most practical,
and at the same time, the sternest parts of his
religious system, with the gorgeous glare of his Olympus,
and with the moral delinquencies of many among
its inhabitants.</p>

<p>As the seniority of Jupiter is upheld by the Erinuës,
so in like manner are the parental rights of Juno,
which had been infringed by Mars, when he changed
sides in the war. Here again, however, it appears as if
more than the mere wish or influence of Juno had been
set aside: for Mars had given a positive promise to
fight for the Greeks, and it is probable that the breach
of this engagement constituted the chief part of the
offence that they were to punish<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their connection with Aides and Persephone.</i></div>

<p>Where the Erinuës touch upon the province of other
deities at all, it is upon that of Persephone and of
Aïdes. If Homer associated Persephone, as I believe
he did, with the Eastern nursery of his race, it was
natural enough that, as has been the case, this part of
his theo-mythology should remain comparatively un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>tainted.
And certainly the Homeric relation between
the Erinuës and the sovereigns of the nether world is
a close one. When, in the Ninth Iliad, Althea, grasping
the earth in her vehemence, as if to lay the strong hand
upon the object of her prayer, invoked Aidoneus and
Persephone to put her son to death, the Poet proceeds
to say that the Erinūs heard her: the Erinūs who stalks
in the darkness heard her, and heard her out of Erebus<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>.
In the case of Phœnix and Amyntor we have exactly
the converse. Here the Erinūs was invoked, and it was
Aides with Persephone that answered the prayer. In
both these instances it must moreover be remembered,
that the question is about present and even immediate,
not about posthumous retribution. We cannot, then,
refuse to admit, that in this manner Persephone with
Aidoneus is placed in an intimate relation with the
administration of retributive justice on earth, and during
the course of human life there: and if the Erinuës are
to be considered as abstractions, having their basis only
in some ulterior impersonation, Persephone and Aidoneus
offer the only objects on whom we can suppose
them to depend. It seems to me, however, that they
are not reciprocally identified, although they are profoundly
connected, and although we read in the connection
a very ancient testimony to a primitive conviction
in mankind, that they must look to the powers of the
other world to redress the deranged balances of this.</p>

<p>Conformably to these ideas, we find that, in the
Nineteenth Iliad, the abode of the Erinuës is fixed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ
γαῖαν</span>: and it is made clear from the passage (259, 60,)
that their avenging office, which is so commonly exercised
in this world, reaches also to the other.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>
<p>From the character of the Erinuës, as vindicators of
an order having deeper foundations than those which
any volition could either lay or shake, there arises that
natural association of them with Destiny, which we see
expressed in the speech of Agamemnon<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>. Both have
in common this idea, that they are not dependent on
mere volition. They differ in these points; that Destiny
prescribes and effectuates action, while the Erinuës
only punish transgression; and that Destiny is but
feebly moral, whereas the Erinuës are profoundly
charged with ethical colouring. They represent that
side of the idea of Destiny which alone can, after being
resolutely scrutinized, retain a hold upon our interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their operation upon man.</i></div>

<p>All the residue of the threads will, I think, run out
easily. It follows from what has been said, that in
their aspect towards man, the Erinuës are not indeed
administrators of the moral laws themselves, but administrators
of their sanctions. So they punish the
infraction of the rights inhering in all natural relations:
the rights of the poor, as Ulysses protests to
Antinous; of a father, as in the case of Amyntor; of a
mother, as in the case of Penelope. But they do much
more than punish the infraction of the rights of persons;
it is the infraction of right as right, which they resent
as a substantive offence. Let us accordingly notice the
function of the Erinūs in those cases where there has
been fault on both sides. An offender is not therefore
secure, because the person who invokes the Erinūs upon
him is an offender too. The father of Phœnix gave the
original occasion to his offence, by an offence of his own:
but Phœnix is punished at his instance notwithstanding,
because the thing which he implores is not a per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>sonal
favour, but is a vindication of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑψίποδες νόμοι</span><a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>,
violated by the incest of his son; a thing right to be
done, whether asked or not. The case of Althea and
Meleager illustrates this truth in a manner still more
lively. When she obtained the intervention of the
Erinūs, she at once suffered by it. The city of Œneus
was all but subjected to the horrors of capture: she
was brought, in bitter humiliation, to supplicate the aid
of the son, on whose head she had just invoked the
stroke of doom. From this we must conclude, which
indeed is not difficult, that the Poet regarded her
prayer as in itself unnatural and cruel; so that the fulfilment
of it involved immediate suffering to herself.
But, on the other hand, Meleager had offended too, in
the slaughter of a near relative. Therefore, although
his pride might well be gratified when he saw king,
priest, and people, with his humbled mother, at his
feet, and proffering their choicest gift in order to
appease him, yet for that original offence, and for his
obstinately refusing to arm until fire was in the city, he
must receive his punishment likewise, in vindication of
the moral laws; accordingly, after he had repulsed the
enemy, he never received the demesne<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>.</p>

<p>The case of Meleager assists to illustrate that of
Œdipus and Epicaste. Both of these unhappy persons
had offended against the moral laws, though it was
unwittingly (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀϊδρείῃσι νόοιο</span>); one, the mother-bride,
was immediately put out of the way: the survivor was
still pursued by the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μητρὸς Ἐρινύες</span>. We see here how
insufficient the idea of a curse, invoked at will, is to
explain the action of these remarkable Powers; for it
does not appear that there was any mother’s curse in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the case: but, because the natural laws were broken in
a matter where the mother was the occasion, therefore,
while both suffer, the sufferings of the son are attributed
to the Erinuës of the mother; the defenders, because
the avengers, of the sanctity of a mother’s place
in relation to her son.</p>

<p>In the case of Melampus, it appears that his undertaking
to obtain the cows of Iphicles or Phylacus was
an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη βαρεῖα</span>, a grave error, beginning in a temptation
suggested to him by the Erinūs, and ending in calamity.
The seizure of these animals would probably be
regarded as no moral offence: and if so, any error that
could lie in the engagement to seize them would be,
according to Homeric estimate, in the nature of folly
rather than of crime. We seem to see, then, in this
place, that the range of Erinūs, like that of Atè, embraced
at a certain point the prudential as well as the
strictly moral laws: nor is there involved in this idea
any violent departure from the true standard, for great
imprudences are most commonly, and almost invariably,
in near connection with some form of moral defect.</p>

<p>It is however also to be observed, that in this place
the Erinūs suggests the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη</span>. The idea lying at the
root of this representation appears to be the profound
one, that the exercise of an evil will is in itself penal:
and that when the mind is already disposed to offend,
retributive justice may take the form of a permission,
encouragement, or incitement, to commit the offence.
We have already seen a very remarkable development
of this idea in the hardening agency of Minerva upon
the Suitors<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>.</p>

<p>According to the view of them which has here been
given, though I could not class the Erinuës with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
traditive deities, it is clear that they must represent,
under metamorphosis, an important association of ideas
belonging to primitive tradition.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the Sixth Class.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The translation of mortals.</i></div>

<p>Those for whom it was a mental necessity to animate
with deity even the mute powers of nature, could not
but find modes of associating man, who stood nearer to
the Immortals, with them and their conditions of
existence.</p>

<p>These modes were chiefly three:</p>

<p>The first, that of translation during life.</p>

<p>The second, that of deification after death.</p>

<p>The third, the conception of races intermediate between
deity and humanity.</p>

<p>And it was perhaps not the simple working of a
fervid imagination, but also an offshoot from this profound
and powerful tendency, which has filled the
pages of Homer with continual efforts to deify what
was most excellent, or most conspicuous, in the mind
or in the person of living man.</p>

<p>The mode of translation during life was early in
date, and was rarely used, for not only are the Homeric
examples of it few, but he records no contemporary
instance.</p>

<p>Ganymede<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>, the son of Tros, was taken up to heaven
by the Immortals on account of his beauty, that
he might live among them. Tithonus, his grand-nephew,
son of Laomedon, was, as we are left to infer,
similarly translated during life, to be the husband of
Aurora (in Homer Eos), or the morning: for Homer
makes him known to us in that capacity, though he does
not mention the translation. In like manner, she carried
up, and placed among the Immortals for his beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Cleitus, one of the descendants of Melampus<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>. A
similar operation to that which was performed upon
Tithonus may have been designed in the case of Orion,
who was the choice of Aurora, and whose career, in
consequence of the jealousy of the Immortals, was cut
short by the arrows of Diana<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>. The course of these
legends seems to stop suddenly in the Greek mythology
at the point where they are replaced by deification:
and the connection of Aurora, as the principal
agent, with three out of the four, (the other, too, is
Asiatic, as being in the family of Dardanus,) seems to
be an unequivocal sign of their eastern character.
Homer places the dwelling of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἤως</span> at a distant point
of the East, near the place where <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάλασσα</span> communicates
with Ocean.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The deification of mortals.</i></div>

<p>In the age of Homer the very first names have
hardly been entered in the class of deified heroes.
Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, may be said to stand at
the head of the list, from the distinct assertion of her
translation, and from her being placed, as the ally of
Ulysses, in continued relations with mortal men<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>. Of
her also it is said that she had obtained divine honours;
and nearly the same assertion is made of Castor and
Pollux. But they perform no offices towards man
while yet in this life. Of this Ino is the only instance.
She appears to be Phœnician rather than Greek, and
thus to belong perhaps to an older, clearly to a distinct
mythology. Hercules, the only one of these persons
who entirely fulfils the conditions of a hero, is admitted
to the banquets of the gods, and united with Hebe<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>:
yet he is not all in Olympus, for his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴδωλον</span>, endowed
with voice and feeling, and bearing martial accoutre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>ments,
is the terror of the Dead. It is not easy to
explain fully this divided state. I cannot but think,
however, that we see here at work that principle of
disintegration, which solved all riddles of character by
making one individual into more than one: beginning,
at least for earth, with that Helen in Egypt, who was
made the depository of the better qualities that post-Homeric
times could not recognise in Helen of Troy.
Although the son of Jupiter, Hercules had on earth,
through a sheer mistake, been subject to a destiny of
grinding toil. His original extraction and personality
stand in sharp contrast with the restless and painful
destiny of his life. Death severs these one from the
other, but Homer, contemplating each as a whole, endows
the last also with personality, and gives it a
reflection in the lower world of its earthly course and
aspect: while the Jove-born Hercules, as it were by a
natural spring, mounts up to heaven<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>. At the same
time there is no more conspicuous example than Hercules,
of that counter-principle of accumulation, by
which legendary tradition heaps upon favourite heroes
all acts not distinctly otherwise appropriated, which appear
to harmonize with their characters; and thus often
makes an historical personage into one both fabulous
and impossible.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that this passage respecting
Hercules was sharply challenged by the Alexandrian
critics. This challenge is discussed, and its justice
affirmed by Nitzsch<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>. Such authorities must not be
defrauded of their weight. But for my own part, I do
not find a proof of spuriousness even in the real inconsistencies
of Homer, where he is dealing with subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
beyond the range of common life and experience.
Still less can it be universally admitted, that what are
called his inconsistencies are really such. They will
often be found to require nothing but the application
of a more comprehensive rule for their adjustment.</p>

<p>It is more difficult still to understand the case of
Orion, who is at once a noted star in heaven, and a
sufferer below in the Shades. There he appears not
wholly unlike the shade of Hercules, a dreamy image
of the sufferings of earth, and at the same time he
ranks among the splendours at least of the material
heaven.</p>

<p>Minos, who is placed in the Shades to exercise royal
functions there, and Rhadamanthus, who has his happy
dwelling on the Elysian plain, are approximative examples
of deification.</p>

<p>It would be hazardous to build any opinion exclusively
on the two verses Il. ii. 550, 551, relating to the
worship of Erechtheus: but they are not altogether at
variance with what we see elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Growth of material for its extension.</i></div>

<p>Such is the rather slender list of personages in
Homer, who approximate in any degree to what was
afterwards the order of deified Heroes. There are,
however, some other indications, that belong immediately
to the living, and that point the same way.
Such is the promise to Menelaus<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>, that instead of
dying he should be translated to Elysium, because he
was the son-in-law of Jupiter. And this suggests other
notes of preparation already found in Homer. Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
promises Nausicaa that, when he has reached his own
country, he will continue to invoke her all his life
long, <i>like a god</i>. The invocation of the Dead was
common. It was not practised only in illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
cases like that of Patroclus. After their battle with
the Cicones, Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> and his crews thrice invoked their
slaughtered comrades. A system of divine parentage was
the fit, one might almost say the certain preparation for
a scheme of divine honours after death; and of such
parentage many of Homer’s heroes could boast. Again,
Peleus was married to a goddess, and the gods in mass
attended the wedding. By thus bringing the inhabitants
of Olympus down to the earth, Homer laid the ground
for bringing the denizens of earth into Olympus.</p>

<p>There is yet a further sign, which, though perhaps
the least palpable, is, when well considered, the most
striking of all. It is this; that sacrifice is offered, in
the Odyssey, to the Shades of the departed. It is not
indeed animal sacrifice that is actually offered. The
gift consists of honey and milk, with wine, water, and
flour<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>: but Ulysses distinctly promises that, on his return
to Ithaca, he will supply this defect by offering a
heifer in their honour, and a sheep all black to Tiresias
in particular. Moreover, he distinctly recognises the
idea of worshipping them<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">πολλὰ δὲ γουνούμην νεκύων ἀμενηνὰ κάρηνα.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It does not destroy the force of this proceeding, that
they were supposed to need or to enjoy the thing sacrificed;
for the Immortals of Olympus did the latter
at least, and there are even traces of the former.
Together with the mixed offering above described,
and the promise of a regular sacrifice on his return
home, Ulysses permitted the Shades to drink of the
blood of the sheep which he immolated on the spot to
Aidoneus and Persephone, after he had fulfilled the
main purpose of his visit by consulting Tiresias<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The dead then have consciousness and activity.
They are invoked by man. They can appear to him.
They are capable of having sacrifices offered to them.
They can confer benefit on the living. Here, gathered
out of different cases, were the materials of full deification.
All that was yet wanting was, that they should
be put together according to rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The kindred of the gods.</i></div>

<p>We have now, lastly, to consider the kindred of the
gods, or races intermediate between deity and humanity,
which Homer has introduced in the Odyssey
exclusively.</p>

<p>These are certainly three, perhaps four;</p>


<ul><li>1. The Cyclopes.</li>
<li>2. The Læstrygonians.</li>
<li>3. The Phæacians.</li>
</ul>

<p>It may also be probable that we should add</p>

<p>4. Æolus Hippotades and his family.</p>

<p>Among them all, the Cyclopes, children of Neptune,
offer, as a work of art, by far the most successful and
satisfactory result. In every point they are placed
at the greatest possible distance from human society
and its conventions. Man is small, the Cyclops huge.
Man is weak, the Cyclops powerful. Man is gregarious,
the Cyclops is isolated. Man, for Homer, is refined;
the Cyclops is a cannibal. Man inquires, searches, designs,
constructs, advances, in a word, is progressive:
the Cyclops simply uses the shelter and the food that
nature finds for him, and is thoroughly stationary.
Yet, while man is subject to death, the Cyclops lives
on, or vegetates at least, and transmits the privileges of
his race by virtue of its high original. The relaxed
morality of the divine seed, as compared with man,
is traceable even in their slight customs. They are
polygamous:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent20">θεμιστεύει δὲ ἕκαστος</div>
       <div class="verse">παίδων ἠδ’ ἀλόχων<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>From their personal characters the moral element has
been entirely dismissed. Polyphemus is a huge mass
of force, seasoned perhaps with cunning, certainly
with falseness. This union of a superhuman life with
the brutal, that dwells in solitude, and has none of
its angles rubbed down by the mutual contact between
members of a race, produces a mixed result of
extreme ferocity, childishness, and a kind of horrible
glee, which as a work of art is most striking and
successful. We may justly think much of Caliban:
but Caliban cannot for a moment be compared to
Polyphemus. It is equitable, however, to remember
that contrast with Ariel, which must have been a
governing condition in the creation of Shakespeare,
required a nature which should be fatuous and grovelling,
as well as coarse.</p>

<p>To feed Polyphemus, what lies nearest him, namely,
the Læstrygonian adventure, has, perhaps, been starved.
Again we are introduced to cruel Giants and to cannibalism,
but with a great scantiness of detail. Their individuality
is scarcely established. Their only marked
qualities they hold in common with the Cyclopes, except
as to a single point, namely, that they live gregariously.
We see their city, and are introduced to their king,
their queen, and their princess<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>. But a too great likeness
to the Cyclops still suggests itself; and it is probable
that in both the one and the other Homer set
before him, among the materials of his work, that old
tradition of powerful beings, allied to the deity, and
yet rebellious against him, which meets us in so many
forms, dispersed about the Homeric poems, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the later tradition, by further multiplication and variety,
resolved into a living chaos.</p>

<p>The Phæacians appear to stand quite in another
category. While the Cyclops has no trace of deity but
in superhuman force, the Phæacians have no pretensions
of this kind. They are not even immortal,
nor are they wholly removed from man, for they are
accustomed to carry passengers by sea; they seem
really to be meant in a measure to represent the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ
ῥεῖα ζώοντες</span>. We must not look too rigidly in them
for notes of the divine character, but rather for the
abundance, opulence, ease, and refinement of the divine
condition. Hence Homer lavishes all the simple wealth
of his imagination upon the palace and garden of
Alcinous, which far exceeds any possessions he has
assigned to ordinary men. This additional splendour
of itself proves, if proof were wanted, that the picture
is ideal. The same amount of ornament assigned to
the palace of Menelaus would, from the contrast with
fact, probably have been frigid to his hearers.</p>

<p>From the games and athletic exercises of this people
all the ruder and more violent sports are excluded.
Navigation, to others so formidable, for them is conducted
by a spontaneous force and intelligence residing
in their ships; which annihilates distance, and at last
excites even the jealousy of Neptune (Od. viii. 555&ndash;69).
We find in the island and in its history no poverty, no
grief, no care, no want; all is fair to see and to enjoy.
But we feel thankful to Homer that he has not here, as
in the case of the Cyclops, made kin with the gods entail
a marked moral or intellectual inferiority upon the sons
of men; no purer or more graceful piece of humanity
is to be found among the creations of the human brain,
than his picture of Nausicaa. She combines in herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
all that earth could suggest of bright, and pure, and fair.
Still it cannot be denied that levity and vanity are rather
conspicuous in the Phæacian men. They shew off,
among other sports, their boxing and wrestling, before
they know what Ulysses is made of. When they know
it, Alcinous informs him in an off-hand way that they
do not pretend to excellence in that class of sports<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>.
After the dancers have performed, Ulysses with great
tact at once passes a high compliment upon them.
Alcinous, delighted with the praise, cries aloud, ‘Phæacian
chiefs! this stranger appears to me to be an
extremely sensible man<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>.’</p>

<p>It appears, however, most likely that, besides the
mythical element in two of them, Homer may have
had some basis of maritime report, and thus of presumed
fact, for his delineations of all these three races; that,
with an unlimited license of embellishment, he, nevertheless,
may have intended in each case to keep unbroken
the tie between his own tale, and the voyages of
Ulysses, founded upon Phœnician geography, as reported
in his time. I form this opinion partly from some
singularities in the Phæacian character, which, as they
are not in keeping with any poetic idea, may probably
have had an historic aim, though I cannot be persuaded
that they afford a foundation broad enough for the full
theory of Mure<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>, if he conceives the Phæacians of the
Odyssey to be strictly a portrait of the Phœnicians.
Partly I draw the inference from the want of clear
severance in the ideals, on which the characters of the
Cyclops and the Læstrygones are severally founded.
The remarkable natural characteristic of Læstrygonia
which he has given us, its perpetual day, supports the
same hypothesis. What would otherwise amount to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
poverty in the imagery is sufficiently accounted for, if
we assume that he meant to describe two savage tribes,
that inhabited the latitudes with which he was dealing;
and that, feeling himself bound to brutality in each case,
he has, under these unfavourable circumstances, varied it
as much as he could. Unless it had been to preserve an
historical or mythological tradition, the Læstrygonian
adventure might hardly have deserved introduction
into the Odyssey. Plainly, on the other hand, he is
not to be held responsible for all that he has put down
while he believed himself to be conforming to narratives
of fact, in the same manner and degree as if he
had been presenting us with a picture in which his
fancy had only to work at will.</p>

<p>The remaining case is slight, and may speedily be dismissed.
Æolus is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φίλος ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι</span>, and is intrusted
with the charge of the winds; and his six sons
are married to his six daughters, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδοίαι ἄλοχοι</span><a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>.
The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φίλος</span> may bear the sense of relationship:
immortality seems to be of necessity involved in the
charge over the winds, who are themselves in the Iliad
(in this point varying poetically from the Odyssey) invested
with deity<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>: and the marriage of the sons to
the daughters affords another absolute proof: for this,
which would have been incest, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέγα ἔργον</span>, among men,
is evidently set down as in their case a legitimate connection.
The great example in the Kronid family would
give it full sanction for the Immortals.</p>

<p>The character of Æolus, if he be human, is one kindly
to his fellow-men; and he inquires carefully respecting
the fate of the Greeks and their chieftains. But it
is very difficult to understand his place in the poem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
and the reasons of it. The gift of Zephyr, and the
folly of the crew in letting out the whole pack of winds,
end only in the return of Ulysses to Æolia, and in his
being dismissed from thence as one hateful to the gods,
which he was not. This Æolus neither seems to be required
for, nor to contribute to, the general purpose of
the poem: nor to represent any ancient tradition: nor
can we in any manner connect him with Æolus, the
great national personage whose descendants were so illustrious,
for that Æolus was clearly taken to be the son
or immediate descendant of Jupiter; so that he could
not have been called the son of Hippotas. Perhaps the
origin of his place in the Odyssey was to be found in
some Phœnician report about storms in the northern
seas, where Æolia is evidently placed in complete isolation,
figured by the sheer and steep rock of the coast,
and by the metal wall which runs round it. It may have
a partial prototype in Stromboli misplaced, the appearance
of which from a distance entirely accords with
this particular of inaccessibility. The whole picture,
representing as it does, first, the ferocity of the winds,
and, secondly, the existence of an efficient control over
them, evidently embodies two features which could not
but enter variously and prominently into the tales of
Phœnician mariners; first, the fierceness of the gales
prevailing in those outer latitudes, to deter others from
attempting them; and secondly, their successful contest
with the difficulty thus created in order to glorify
themselves.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">SECT. V.<br />

<i>The Olympian Community and its Members,
considered in themselves.</i></h2></div>

<p>The substitution of polytheism for the monotheistic
principle not only brought down deity in the measure
of its attributes or faculties towards man, but
created a necessity for a divine economy or polity,
which should regulate the relations of the Immortals.
This polity could be no other than human, and no
other, as it seems, than a somewhat deteriorated copy
from its earthly original.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The family order in Olympus.</i></div>

<p>Accordingly, the Olympian Immortals of Homer are
combined in a society. They are not a mere aggregate
of beings, classed together by the mind in virtue of the
possession of common properties, but they live in twofold
relations: first, those of the family, or at least of
descent and consanguinity; secondly, those established
by a political organization, which is modelled according
to the forms of the Greek polities subsisting in the
Homeric age.</p>

<p>The government of Olympus is, though the use of
the word may at first excite a smile, in principle constitutional.
Jupiter is its head. Its ordinary council or
aristocracy is represented by the body of such deities
as have palaces there, constructed for them by Vulcan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
who exercises in the community the double function
at once of architect and artificer<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>.</p>

<p>The immediate relationship of nearly all these divinities
to Jupiter is recorded.</p>

<p>As his brothers, we have Neptune, and Aidoneus, or
Pluto.</p>

<p>As his wives, we have Juno, the chief; Latona, Dione,
and probably Demeter, secondary.</p>

<p>As his children, we have Minerva, Apollo and Diana,
Mars and Vulcan, Venus, Mercury, Hebe.</p>

<p>Of the Nineteen Deities who appear to be certainly
Olympian, there are only four that do not fall at once
into the family order: they are Themis, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span>, Iris, and
Paieon. There may have been a relationship credited
in these cases also, though it is not recorded. It should
be observed, that Jupiter is expressly invested with the
title of Father of the gods. And perhaps the idea
intended to be conveyed is that of a family which has
grown into a sept or clan, having this for its distinctive
character, that all the members of it, great and small,
have either a nearer or a more remote relationship to
the head. Of the minor deities, in various cases it is
recorded, that they are daughters of Jupiter; such as
the Muses, the Prayers, and the Nymphs of most
orders. But these have the appearance of belonging to
Homer’s poetry, more than to his mythology. Among
male deities, the sons of Jupiter are all in Olympus:
those of Neptune take lower rank.</p>

<p>Whatever be its relation to the family <i>nucleus</i>, the
community of Olympus is fully formed. Besides Jupiter
the head, and the ordinary assembly, its Council
or Court, which answers to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ</span> of the Greeks, it
has its Agorè, a greater Assembly or Parliament called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
together upon crises of extraordinary solemnity, such as
the decision by main force of the fate of Troy.</p>

<p>But as we have no example, except the factious and
utterly odious Thersites, of any one of the commonalty
who takes an actual part in debate among men, so the
minor deities, too, are mute in heaven.</p>

<p>Nay, the resemblance is even closer than this.
The Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ</span>, and also the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγορὴ</span>, have their speaking
or leading personages, and they likewise have each
their silent members. The leaders are Agamemnon,
Nestor, Ulysses, and Diomed; the last-named chieftain
always with modesty, as a person lately come to full age.
Achilles doubtless would have had to be added, if the
action of the poem had permitted him to appear throughout
its debates. But we never hear of the Ajaxes, Idomeneus,
or chiefs like Eurypylus, as taking any active
share in the proceedings. Even so the discussions of
Olympus appear to be conducted commonly by Jupiter,
Juno, Neptune<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>, Minerva, and Apollo<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>. Once Vulcan
interposes, in his mother’s interest: possibly he may
have been suggested to the Poet by Thersites<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> as a
terrestrial counterpart. The Sun appeals to the Assembly
in the Odyssey, as a party in his own cause: but
neither he nor Venus, nor Mars, nor Mercury, nor any
other subordinate deity, ever appears as taking part in
a discussion.</p>

<p>The term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγορὴ</span>, or assembly, is used in Homer for
the meetings of the deities only on certain occasions:
namely, at the openings of the Eighth and Twentieth
Books<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>. The other, or ordinary meetings, have no

frequent mention, either of the banquet as proceeding,
or of the cup as in the hands of the deities. They were
standing assemblages of the deities, the law of whose
life was leisure, with prolonged though not intemperate
feasting; and its ordinary scene Olympus.
Their correspondence with the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ</span> must not be
pressed too far, for they do not, like the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ</span>,
commonly precede an Assembly. It is to be remembered,
that the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ</span> was an Hellenic institution,
and that the gods were not exclusively Hellenic, though
Olympus was essentially national.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The political order in Olympus.</i></div>

<p>The analogy between the divine and the human
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγοραὶ</span> is established in a pointed form by the Poet
himself; who makes Themis the pursuivant or Summoner<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
for the former; and also says of her, with respect
to the latter,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἥτ’ ἀνδρῶν ἀγορὰς ἠμὲν λύει, ἠδὲ καθίζει<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The acknowledgment of a rule of right, extrinsic and
superior to ourselves, is general in the Assemblies of
men in Homer, when meeting for business. This there
could not be in the Assemblies of the Olympian gods.
Neither does respect for authority and for tradition
well harmonize with the idea of beings, who are possessed
of unbounded, or at the least of greatly extended
intelligence. Thus, like the individual deities,
the divine Assemblies, and the entire Polity, are deprived
of the greatest moral safeguards of their counterparts
on earth. The consequence is, that their ethical
tone is much lower. Force is the only effective sanction
of authority among the Immortals. This is curiously
exhibited in the Theomachy: for that battle
takes place when the fate of Troy, which formed the
matter in dispute, has already been long ago decided.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
Whenever a difficulty arises, which will bear that mode
of treatment, Jupiter resorts to the threat of using it,
even against divinities so dignified and powerful as
Minerva, Neptune, and Juno. Sometimes, indeed, he
parades it by anticipation, even when no symptom of
disaffection has yet been exhibited.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> So, on the other
hand, fraud is the resource of the weak, as violence is
of the strong. Juno, unable to organize a combination
against her husband, devises a trick.</p>

<p>The deities, then, are not under any effective ethical
restraint; and the only instances in which the highly
moral sentiment of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> is mentioned as governing
them in their reciprocal conduct are cases of the two
great traditive divinities, Minerva and Apollo, with
reference to their uncle Neptune, and of Jupiter, in
whose case it is a sentiment of politeness rather than
of duty, with reference to Thetis<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>.</p>

<p>But, although moral principle and religious reverence
are absent, two principles of considerable value
and utility remain. One of them is a certain courtesy
or comity, which prevails in the absence of strong countervailing
causes. Secondly, the power of intelligence
is very visible in the working of their polity. It is not
the mere wish of Jupiter, it is his counsel, which is
fulfilled in the Trojan war. And again, it is not his individual
counsel, but it is the decision which he adopts
in compliance with the general sentiment of the gods<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>.
He could be well content to let Troy stand, because of
the abundance of its offerings; but he sees that if he
attempts to give effect to such a plan as he would personally
prefer, he must encounter the stubborn resistance
of the three strongest deities, Neptune, Juno, and
Minerva. Perhaps this difference of opinion might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
issue in the shape of a war in heaven, and that war
might follow the same course as the one happily arrested
by Briareus: therefore he avoids the issue,
makes the concession without letting himself seem to
make it, and thus preserves his general position at the
head of the Olympian body.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Courtesy and Intelligence among the Immortals.</i></div>

<p>Speaking of mythological deity as such, the difference
of celestial from human intelligence is a difference
of degree rather than of kind. The process of
deliberation in the mind of a mortal, and the state of
suspense before decision, are frequent subjects of Homeric
description. And he sometimes places individual
deities before us with the same, or nearly the same,
detail, as in cases occurring among men, of doubt preceding
determination. The essence and foundation of
the process are similar, as we see in the case of Juno,
and again in the instance of Jupiter himself. She
ponders the question how she shall delude Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">μερμήριξε δ’ ἔπειτα βοῶπις πότνια Ἥρη</div>
       <div class="verse">ὅππως ἐξαπάφοιτο Διὸς νόον αἰγιόχοιο.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And then she decides;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἥδε δέ οἱ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλὴ, κ.τ.λ.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So he<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>, in his turn, considers long, before determining
that Patroclus shall carry the war from the ships to the
walls. Again, for the great decrees which are to have
an extensive influence on human destiny, to argue and
consider seem to be a moral necessity among the gods,
as much as important subjects require public debate
among men.</p>

<p>The method of reflecting Earth in the Olympian life
is sometimes carried by the Poet down to the details
of social intercourse. Thus it is a terrestrial custom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the heroic age, that strangers are entertained before
they are called upon to give an account of their business<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>.
And this hospitable practice extends even to
the treatment of those who are charged with important
communications; so that Bellerophon is entertained
for nine full days by the king of Lycia, while he has in
his pocket the roll containing a request for him to be
put to death<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>. In exact conformity with this manner
of proceeding, Mercury<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> is feasted by Calypso in Ogygia,
before he delivers the weighty message, with
which he had been intrusted by Jupiter in the name
of the whole Olympian court.</p>

<p>Although we have found it difficult in one or two
cases to pronounce with respect to certain divine personages,
whether they are Olympian or not, yet in
principle the line is clearly drawn, which marks off the
superiority of the members of the Olympian Court.
We find it in the express declaration of Calypso<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>. We
find it perhaps yet more clearly noted in the comparison
between Venus and Thetis: for we have seen, as to the
former of these deities, her extreme feebleness and incapacity
in everything, except as regards the particular
impulse that she represents. Thetis, on the other
hand, is full of activity and intelligence; and is gifted
with bodily powers sufficient to fly like a hawk from
Olympus, when carrying the celestial arms (whose inherent
buoyancy, however, must not be forgotten<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>).
Yet, doubtless because not Olympian, she yields the
palm to Venus: for Apollo says to Æneas of Achilles<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent6">καὶ δέ σέ φασι Διὸς κούρης Ἀφροδίτης</div>
       <div class="verse">ἐκγεγάμεν· κεῖνος δὲ χερείονος ἐκ θεοῦ ἐστίν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their unity imperfect.</i></div>

<p>Though the body of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ</span> serve as an unity to point a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
moral in the abstract, there is practically a wonderful
want of unity and of common or corporate feeling
among them. This is figured in the Judgment of
Paris: in the love of Neptune for the Cyclops, who
renounce the authority of Jupiter: again in his aversion
to the Phæacians, who are so beloved by the gods
in general, that they appear in their proper shape at the
religious festivals of those favoured islanders<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this want of the genuine corporate
spirit, and notwithstanding the prevalence of
essentially selfish appetite as the rule of life with the
greater part, at any rate, of the Immortals, it would
not be just to say that the principle of unity in the
Divine Government is wholly destroyed by the Homeric
polytheism. The superiority of Jupiter, though
it does not amount to supremacy in the stricter sense<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>,
is yet sufficiently decided to place him far above any
other single deity in sheer power. Therefore, when
considered as the executive of the Olympian system,
he is upon the whole equal to his work. He may be
deceived, and so baffled for a moment, as by Juno in
the Fourteenth Iliad; but it is for a moment only. Or
the insubordination of some particular divinity may
approach to resistance, like that of Neptune in the
Fifteenth: but, upon admonition, conscious inferiority
soon brings the matter to a close. So much for the
execution of divine behests. As to the legislative process,
however, heaven strictly follows earth, with only
such exceptions as are accounted for by the difference
in the constituent elements.</p>

<p>The influence or even the menaces of a powerful
leader, the moral force of persuasion, the comparison of
the means of coercive action on this side and on that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
and again the composition of wills and opinions to obtain
a joint result, all these, the leading processes by which
free institutions work on earth, with substantial identity,
though with more awkwardness of form and less of
genial freedom, as might be expected in transplanted
ideas, are also the processes by which supreme and
providential decrees are arrived at. Of the degree to
which this principle of free polity prevails, we can have
no better criterion than in the fate of Troy. It fell,
not merely from the personal prudence of Jupiter, but
because acting as a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλεὺς</span> in heaven, like Agamemnon
upon earth, he yielded to the preponderating influence
of that section in Olympus, which was indeed
apparently less numerous, but of commanding strength,
influence, and activity.</p>

<p>Nor would it be just to Homer and his Olympus to
forget, that in yielding to the powerful party led by
Juno, Neptune, and Minerva, Jupiter was also yielding
up the vicious, and sealing the triumph of the virtuous
cause.</p>

<p>Thus, then, while we see the spirit of anthropophuism
breaking down the principle of the Unity of God, from
its being too feeble and too blind to maintain the pure
traditions in which it was conveyed, it is still curious
to the last degree to observe the order and symmetry
of the Greek mind, even in its destructive processes.
For, as we have found, it arranges its groups of deities
around a centre, by the principle that creates a Family:
and then gives them community of counsel, and unity
of action, by the principle that maintains a State.
What is this, but to bring in the resources and expedients,
which our human state supplied, to repair, after
a sort, the havock which it had made in the Divine
Idea?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The system not uniform.</i></div>

<p>But although symmetry was thus far, if not studied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
yet spontaneously produced, we have ample proof that
Homer neither inherited nor invented for his gods any
uniform and consistent code of rules, intellectual, moral,
or political. Neither, again, in the region of sense did he
make any general provision to determine the conditions
of divine being and action for his gods as an order, or
even for particular classes of them. The want of such
consistency is, indeed, among the striking proofs of the
profound dualism of origin in his Theo-mythology. All
that we can do is to observe his prevailing modes of
treatment, and collect a general meaning from them.
Proceeding thus, we shall find that the class of Immortals
enjoys in various ways a marked superiority to
man; but the degrees of this superiority, as they are
nowhere precisely defined, so they vary greatly in the
cases of the different deities: and when, striking off
all the particular characteristics of individual members
of the system, we attempt to embody what is common
to them all, we leave but a slight and jejune residuum.</p>

<p>Nor is the classification of the differences a regular
one. If we compare his delineations of some lower with
some higher deities, we must be struck with finding considerable
appearances of want of analogy between them.
Some inferior persons of the same order, as we shall
see, may excel in particular gifts, even those who are
on the whole their superiors. Thus Circe, and even
the Sirens, have powers greater apparently than, in the
same subject-matter, Mercury or Vulcan. Heterogeneous
origin, and imperfect assimilation, afford the true
explanation of these phenomena.</p>

<p>It may be laid down as a general rule, that the
divine life of Olympus, wherever it reproduces the
human, reproduces it in a degraded form. Enjoyment
and indulgence, when carried from earth to heaven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
lose that limit of honourable relation to labour as
necessary restoratives, which alone makes them respectable
on earth.</p>

<p>In general, the chief note of deity with Homer is
emancipation from the restraints of the moral law.
Though the Homeric gods have not yet ceased to be
the vindicators of morality upon earth, they have personally
ceased to observe its rules either for or among
themselves.</p>

<p>As compared with men in conduct, they are generally
characterised by superior force and intellect, but
by inferior morality.</p>

<p>They do not appear to have been governed in their
relations towards one another by any motives drawn
either from the law of right and justice, or from that
of affection: unless&mdash;an exception which confirms the
rule&mdash;where the attachment belonging to the human
relation of parent and child is faintly reflected among
the Immortals, as when Jupiter calls Minerva or Diana
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φίλον τέκος</span><a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>, and Venus <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέκνον ἐμόν</span><a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>: again, in the
care taken of Venus after she is wounded by her
mother Dione<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>, and, more slightly indicated, in that
of Diana by Latona<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>. In the conduct of Mars on the
death of Ascalaphus, the impulse is momentary, and it
has a strong animal tinge which seems to overpower,
like a fit of drunkenness, the little reason that he possesses.
The grief of Jupiter for Sarpedon is the only
case of an intense affection among the Immortals. And
it is remarkable, that this is felt towards, not a brother
or sister divinity, but a mortal; towards one of those
Lycians, whom Homer regards with such extraordinary
and unvarying favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>Force and fraud their chief instruments.</i></div>

<p>The general principles of government, then, among
the Immortals themselves are simply those of force
and terror, on the one hand, or fraud and wheedling
on the other. For example, Terror subdues the adverse
will of Juno<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> in the First Book, of Juno and
Minerva in the Eighth<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>, and of Neptune, not without
much reluctance on his part, in the Fifteenth. Thetis
wheedles Jupiter in the First Book<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>; Juno entirely
beguiles him, besides outwitting Venus, in the Fourteenth;
Minerva entraps Apollo in the Seventh into
the plan of a single combat, which saves the Greeks
from an impending defeat. And the difference of
opinion respecting Troy in the divine Assembly does
not at the last come to effect without a contest of main
strength, although the virtual decision of the Olympian
body had long ago been taken. Nay, these principles of
force and fraud are the real principles of action, even
when not altogether on the surface. When Mercury
declines battle with Latona, it is because he fears the
consequences of a contest with a wife of Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>. In
a manner still more curious, when Apollo has declined
battle with Neptune, professedly on the ground that it
is not worth the while of deities to fight about the
affairs of wretched mortals, the Poet explains his conduct
by a sentiment partly of deference arising out of
a relationship recognised among men:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent24">αἴδετο γάρ ῥα</div>
       <div class="verse">πατροκασιγνήτοιο μιγήμεναι ἐν παλάμῃσιν<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But here there may possibly have been some mixture
of fear, because, as he withdraws, he is reproached
bitterly by Diana, called a baby for his cowardice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
reminded, that he had himself volunteered the boast
in heaven, that he was ready to fight against Neptune.</p>

<p>As these moral elements had been almost wholly
eliminated from the general principles which govern
the Homeric gods in their relations to one another, so
likewise we look almost in vain for the traces of them
in their individual conduct. They observe, when acting
for themselves, neither courage, justice, nor prudence;
but it is in regard to moral temperance or self-control,
that they fall furthest below the standard even of human
virtue. The Mahometan heaven of men was the heaven
of the Homeric gods. Their standing employment, except
when troubled by human affairs, is simply in perpetual,
though not drunken or brutal, feasting; sometimes
in grosser indulgences. If, says Vulcan to his mother,
you quarrel about mortals, it will be a pestilent business,
for there will be no pleasure in our banquets<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>.
If Neptune in the Odyssey is gone among the Ethiopians<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>,
it is for a hecatomb of bulls and lambs. If
Jupiter and all the gods make a journey to the same
quarter in the Iliad, it is for a feast<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>, which apparently
was to last for eleven days. If Hercules has earned
the reward of his labours by being taken up to heaven,
his life there is described as a life entitling him to
enjoy banquets among the Immortals<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>. If Ganymede
is received into their company, it is that he may discharge
for Jupiter the duty of cup-bearer<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>, in which it
would appear that both Vulcan and Hebe were likewise
employed. Of all the phrases characteristic of
the Homeric gods and their life, there is none that
sits better than the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζώοντες</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>Their dominant selfishness.</i></div>

<p>Deeper, even than their collective devotion to mere
enjoyment, lies their intense and profound selfishness.
We cannot fail to note the absence of those sentiments
of justice and self-sacrifice, and those high enthusiastic
emotions, which do so much to ennoble the human life
of the heroic age. There is truth in the assertion that
they establish and administer a one-sided law:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὣς γὰρ ἐπεκλώσαντο θεοὶ δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσι,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>But beyond this, there lies a deep meaning in the
sentiment of an Italian poet, Guarini<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
       <div class="verse">Guarda, che nel disumanarti</div>
       <div class="verse">Non divenga una fera, anzi che un Dio.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Greek mythology, departing from the very basis
of the Divine idea in the conception of its gods, converts
them, by a moral necessity, not into man, but
into something which is morally beneath man. There
is not among all the deities what we can call one full
unbroken development of noble character. They are, as
a general rule, except so far as they are modified by
the traditive element, Titanic creations of intellect or
power, or both, without virtue. Even where, as in the
cases of Minerva and Diana, they are pure, their purity
does not inspire or impress the Poet with half the force
and fire which he must have felt when he drew the
matron Andromache, or the maid Nausicaa. But this is
not the common case. With great reservation indeed
as to the traditional, in comparison with the mythical
divinities, and likewise as to the female deities, in
comparison with the gods, we must admit that, as a
general rule, the Immortals of Homer, when brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the bar of a cool inquiry, are in their own personal conduct
impure voluptuaries, and that the laws, which
formed the basis of family life, and which in Homer’s
time still kept human society from total corruption, for
them had no restraining power, indeed no recognised
existence.</p>

<p>There is no sense of shame accompanying the excesses
of the gods, such as Homer has marked, not without
tenderness, in regard to the trespass of Astyoche<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>;</p>

       <div class="verse">παρθένος αἰδοίη, ὑπερώϊον εἰσαναβᾶσα.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the contrary, Jupiter refers with marked self-satisfaction
to his affairs of this kind in the Fourteenth
Iliad; and shows the very temper, described by Saint
Paul as that of the most advanced depravity, which
not only yields to temptation, but seals its own
offence with habitual and deliberate approval<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Οὐ
μόνον αὐτὰ ποιοῦσιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ συνευδοκοῦσι τοῖς πράσσουσιν.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Cruelty of Calypso in her love.</i></div>

<p>We may take Calypso as no unfair specimen of the
ethics of the Immortals. In the hope of sensual pleasure,
she keeps Ulysses a prisoner in her far island. She
sees him pining in wretchedness for his home and
family from day to day; and well knows the distress
that his absence must cause to a virtuous wife and son,
as well as the public evils, sure to arise from the prolonged
absence of a wise and able sovereign. Yet she
never relents, but still in her odorous cavern she sings to
the movement of her golden distaff. (Od. v. 59.) When
Hermes makes known to her the decree that she cannot
resist for his return, she complains of the cruelty
of the upper gods, but adds, ‘as I cannot help myself,
let him perish if Zeus will.’ She promises, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
to send him off in safety, and keeps her word; but it is
when she has been well warned by Mercury of the
consequences of disobedience, and firmly bound by
Ulysses with the oath which was terrible even to the
Immortals. (Od. v. 146, 184.)</p>

<p>The sentiment of envy, which they had begun to
entertain towards men, appears also to have been felt
towards members of the divine order. It was envy
with which the gods viewed the happiness enjoyed by
Aurora in her union with Orion, till it ended with his
death; and that moved Jupiter to destroy Iasion, the
object of the choice of Demeter<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>. But this (so says Calypso)
was envy of the male towards the female deities.
There is no reciprocal sentiment: and it is curious here
to observe the inequality of the sexes, together with so
many other signs and beginnings of corruption, established
among the Immortals in a manner unknown to
human society at the time.</p>

<p>Calypso may or may not be justified in the charge
she makes against the gods; but, at least, it seems
clear that, though they have some regard to the prevalence
of moral laws as between one man and another,
they by no means impute any moral guilt to her
in her cruel detention of Ulysses, even while they rectify
a wrong by their decree.</p>

<p>The inferiority of the moral standard, which marks
the order of gods, is likewise traceable in the various
races which are described by Homer as claiming a
special relationship to them; the Cyclopes, the Læstrygonians,
and even perhaps the Phæacians. Against the
last of these we can certainly charge no more than an
epicurean and inglorious ease: but the two former not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
only do not forfeit, they even prove, their relationship
to the gods by being at once more strong and more
vicious than common men.</p>

<p>And, as it affects the kindred of the Immortals in
common with themselves, so also does it extend from
the sphere of morals into that of manners. While
Hephæstus was ministering to them the festal cup,
they laughed ungovernably at his personal deformity<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>.
Now, the Greeks laugh at Thersites<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> when he has
been beaten, but it is in immediate connection with
his misconduct, and it has nothing whatever to do with
his ugliness. Laughter at mere deformity is nowhere
found in Homer: and would entirely jar with the
tone of feeling that pervades Homeric manners. The
action that offers the nearest approach to it confirms
the spirit of this observation. It is the hurling of the
stool by the Suitor Antinous<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> at the apparently decrepit
Ulysses; which is sternly registered, along with
the other outrages of that depraved company, for the
coming day of retribution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Olympian as compared with heroic life.</i></div>

<p>In a word, still setting aside in some considerable
degree the deities of traditive origin, who enter little
into the general picture, but have their own portraiture
apart, there are to be found in Olympus, as well as in the
lower earth, the relations of degree in power and intelligence;
and the gods with whom it is peopled, on the
whole, possess it in large measure; but the law and
purpose of their life is summed up in self-will and self-indulgence.
They do not debate their own duties, or
even those of men, to one another: rarely, if ever,
those of men even towards themselves, except with reference
to the quantity of libation poured out, of flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
offered, and of steam reeking from the altars. There
is a mixture in their enjoyments: some are refined,
others sensual, but both are alike selfish, and the latter
are wholly unrestrained. It is said by Heyne, and with
much of literal truth, that the description of the day’s
employment in Olympus, which the first Iliad supplies,
is a transcript of hero-life<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>; but it is of one part of
hero-life only; it is of hero-life in its moments of indulgence
and relaxation, which exhibit to us its lower
and less noble side, without any view of its great sentiments
and great duties, its sense of honour, its fine
feeling, its reciprocal affections as developed in the relations
of consanguinity and affinity, of friendship, of
guestship, of sovereign and subject, and even of master
and serf. What a wretched spectacle would Hector,
Achilles, Diomed, Nestor, Ulysses, and the rest present
to us, were their existence devoted simply to quaffing
goblets and scenting or devouring the flesh of slain
animals, even though with this there were present the
mitigating refinement of perpetual harp and song.
And yet such is the picture offered by the Homeric
mythology.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, while it remains true that the deification
of heroes, or their promotion to a happy immortality,
in Homer’s time, depended upon virtue and
merit; those who thus obtained admission to Olympus
really found themselves introduced to a new and
far lower law of life, upon taking their places there,
than that to which they had been accustomed upon
earth. Thus, for example, it is with Hercules; he has indeed
a reward beyond the grave; but it consists simply
in a life divested of the virtues of patience, obedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>ence,
valour, and struggle by which it had itself been
earned.</p>

<p>The superiority, however, of the intellectual over the
material element, except in the matter of self-indulgence,
is, as we might have expected, decisively maintained
in the Grecian mythology. It is exhibited most
clearly, perhaps, in the triumph of Jupiter and Olympus
over the brute might of the Titans. It is also palpable,
when we find that the strength of Mars, who represents
nothing except fighting force, does not always
insure his victory, even in contests of mere strength,
but that he is overthrown by Minerva in the battle of
the gods, corrected at will by her on all other occasions<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>,
and wounded, with her aid, by the hero Diomed
beneath the walls of Troy. But when we speak of
intellect as opposed to matter, the case stands so
differently with respect to different deities, that it is
necessary to attempt a stricter appreciation than we
have yet aimed at obtaining, of their common character.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their exemption from Death uniform.</i></div>

<p>The great and perhaps only essential property by
which the Homeric gods are distinguished, is that expressed
in their very common appellation of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀθάνατος</span>:
they are immortal.</p>

<p>There is something curious in the question, why it is
that they are endowed uniformly and absolutely with
this gift, but not with others; why the limitation of
Death is removed from them, and yet other limitations
are allowed in so many respects to remain.</p>

<p>It seems as if we had here an independent and impartial
testimony to the truth of the representation
conveyed in Holy Writ, that death has been the spe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>cific
punishment ordained for sin: and that therefore
in passing beyond the human order we, as a matter of
course, pass beyond its range.</p>

<p>Had the preternatural system of the Poet exhibited
to us only such divinities as are the representatives of
primeval tradition, it would have been easy to account
for the attribute of immortality. But here are a multitude
of deities, the creatures of human invention;
why was this gift bestowed on them, when others were
withheld? It may be, again, because that which came
last into man’s condition should, in the logical and
moral order, go first out of it: that in framing the
conception of an existence higher than that of man,
the first step properly was, before dealing with the
more positive faults or imperfections inherent in his
nature, to set aside that which did not belong to it,
but had been set upon it as a note of shame for a
special cause, like letters branded on a deserter or a
slave.</p>

<p>In Homer it appears that every deity, great and
small alike, is exempt from death. A Fragment of
Hesiod<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> proceeds on a basis abstractedly different, and
by an ingenious multiplication, from the term assigned
to man upwards, ascribes to the Nymphs a life of
291,600 years. In all likelihood the meaning of this
passage may be not to curtail immortality, but to enlarge
the practical conception of it, by carrying life up
to a number which would impress the minds of a generation
rude in arithmetic far more, than a merely
abstract assertion of immortality: just as to us the
sand of the sea, or even the hairs of the head, may
more impressively convey the idea of unlimited num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>bers
than does the phrase innumerable, although in
reality the effect of either figure is to limit them.</p>

<p>Calypso is of the lower and of the most earthy order
of the Homeric divinities. She recognises in plain
terms her inferiority to the Olympian gods, by stating
that she will send with Ulysses a favourable breeze,
which will carry him safely home, provided <i>they</i> permit
it, who are so far her superiors, both in planning, and
in executing what they plan<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">αἴ κε θεοί γ’ ἐθέλωσι, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν,</div>
       <div class="verse">οἵ μευ φέρτεροί εἰσι νοῆσαί τε κρῆναί τε.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Yet she distinctly contrasts herself with Penelope, in
the very point that she is immortal: and the reply
of Ulysses recognises this as the essential difference<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἡ μὲν γὰρ βροτός ἐστι, σὺ δ’ ἀθάνατος καὶ ἀγήρως.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The only cases, perhaps, in which Homer glances at
the possibility of putting a period to the existence of a
god, are two, in which the semi-brutal Mars is concerned.
When Otus and Ephialtes put him in chains,
it seems that, but for Eeriboia, he would have perished<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>:
the expressions are,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">καί νύ κεν ἔνθ’ ἀπόλοιτο Ἄρης ἆτος πολέμοιο.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And again, under the assault of Diomed, though the
Poet does not bring this last extremity into view, he
might, had he not fled, perhaps have been as good as
dead (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζὼς ἀμένηνος</span>, Il. v. 887). This is not death, but
it is at any rate the suspension of life, apparently without
limit. A third alternative is opened in the severe
reply of Jupiter, who observes to him, that he might
have been thrust down into Tartarus, but for the fortu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>nate
accident of his high parentage; veiling the idea
under the modest words<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">καί κεν δὴ πάλαι ἦσθα ἐνέρτερος Οὐρανιώνων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus then the divine life, which, however, certainly
with Ares is lodged in one of its least godlike receptacles,
is liable to degradation, and to abeyance, even
possibly to a lingering, though probably in no case to a
rapid, process of extinction. But this last is rather the
limit of calamity only, in the mathematical sense; that
is to say, a limit which is never actually reached,
though there is nothing short of it which may not be
reached and even passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Exemption from other limitations partial.</i></div>

<p>So much for the great gift of immortality. With
reference to all the other limitations imposed upon
finite being, the position of the Immortals, infinitely
diversified according to the two great classes, and to
individual cases, has this one feature applying to it as
a whole, that it is a position of preference, not of independence.</p>

<p>Every deity has some extension of personal liberties
and powers beyond what men enjoy. But it is in
general such as we should conceive to be rather characteristic
of intermediate orders of creation, than properly
attaching to the divine nature. We must however
distinguish between these three things: 1. The
personal exemptions of a divinity from the restraints of
time and place, and other limiting conditions; 2. The
general powers capable of being exercised over other
gods, over man, over animal or inanimate nature;
3. The powers enjoyed within the particular province
over which a divinity presides.</p>

<p>Thus for example Calypso, though, as we have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
she is of inferior rank, yet exercises very high prerogatives.
She sends with Ulysses a favourable breeze:
and she predicts calamity, which is to smite him before
he reaches his home. Circe transforms men into beasts,
and then restores them to forms of greater beauty and
stature<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>. She is cognizant of events in the world beneath,
and of what will occur on the arrival of Ulysses
there. She then sends a favourable breeze to impel his
vessel<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>; and on his return predicts to him the circumstances
of his homeward voyage<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>. And Proteus delivers
a similar prediction to Menelaus, to which he adds a
declaration of his destiny after death<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>: he also converts
himself into a multitude of forms.</p>

<p>Now no Homeric deities order winds to blow, except
Jupiter, Juno, Apollo, and Minerva; none issue predictions
to men except Minerva and Apollo, the latter
mediately, through Seers or through Oracles; of absolute
transformation we have no example; but Minerva,
and she alone, transforms Ulysses from one human form
to another. I mean absolute transformation effected
upon others: all the deities, apparently, can transform
themselves at will; for even Venus appears to Helen
disguised, though it would seem imperfectly, in the
form of an aged attendant<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>.</p>

<p>This gift of knowledge of the future is the more remarkable,
when we consider that some of the Olympian
deities were without knowledge even of what had
just happened; as Mars, on the occasion of the death of
his son Ascalaphus<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>. Even Jupiter, with the rest of
the gods, was wholly unaware of the clandestine mission
of Iris by Juno to Achilles<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>Cases of minor deities with major powers.</i></div>

<p>The great powers of these secondary deities may be
accounted for, I think, by two considerations:</p>

<p>1. These divinities belong to the circle of outer or
Phœnician traditions, and the Poet is not therefore, in
treating them, subject to the same laws as those by which
he regulates the Olympian order. They are brought
upon the stage with reference to Ulysses or Menelaus,
and in the Wanderings only; thus they are adopted by
Homer for this special purpose, and endowed with
whatever gifts they require for it, just as strangers,
while they remain, are treated more liberally in a house
than the children of the family, for the very reason that
they are strangers, and have no concern with the regular
organization and continuing life of the household.</p>

<p>2. Another principle of the mythology conducts us
by another road to the same end. Every deity is liberally
endowed within his own province. Now the province
of Proteus, Calypso, and Circe, is the Outer
sphere of Geography. Within the range of that sphere,
the ordinary agency of the Olympian deities individually
is suspended. Homer prefers to leave it to be
governed by the divinities, whom he can frame out of
his Phœnician materials for the purpose. In this way
he is enabled to enlarge the circle of variety, and to
draw new and salient lines of distinction between the
two worlds. Neptune indeed is there perforce; for navigation
is the staple of its theme, and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάλασσα</span> pervades
it, from no portion of which can he possibly be
excluded. The Olympian Court, too, oversee it, and their
orders are conveyed thither by Mercury their agent.
But, except Neptune for the reason given, the ordinary
action of the deities individually is suspended<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>, not on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
account of any limitation of power, for instance in Minerva,
but for a poetical purpose, and with the excuse,
that the whole sphere is removed beyond common life
and experience. Hence, just as Vulcan works professionally
the most extraordinary miracles, though he is
but a secondary deity, because they are in the domain
of metallic art, so Circe and the rest are empowered to
do the like within a domain of which they are the
rooted zoophytes and exclusive occupants.</p>

<p>It may be well, before passing to the general limitations
upon divine capacity in Homer, to illustrate a
little farther this law of special endowment.</p>

<p>Venus is among gods what Nireus was among men:
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄναλκις ἔην θεός</span><a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>. Yet she overcomes the resistance of
Helen<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>: and we have also the express record of her
girdle as invincible in its operation<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>. The case of Mars
is peculiar: for he is brought upon the stage to be
beaten in his own province, as the exigencies of the
poem require it: but inferior, nay pitiful, as he is in
every point of mind and character, yet as to imposing
personal appearance, he is made to take rank in a comparison
with Jupiter and Neptune, between whose
names his is placed<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>. Neptune exhibits vast power,
and on his own domain, the sea, appears even to have
an inkling of providential foreknowledge<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>: he is conscious
that Ulysses will reach Scheria. Except upon
the sea, he exhibits no such attributes of intelligence,
though he always remains possessed of huge force.
Mercury, again, shows in locomotion a greater independence
of the laws of place, than some deities who
are of a rank higher than his own: and doubtless it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
because he is professionally an agent or messenger.
Even so the journeys of Iris are no sooner begun than
they are accomplished.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Divine faculties an extension of human.</i></div>

<p>But the general rule is, that the divine faculties represent,
in regard to all the conditions of existence,
no more than an improvement and extension of the
human<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>. Man is the point of origin: and from this
pattern invention strives to work upward and outward.
The great traditive deities indeed are on a different
footing, and appear rather to be the reductions and
depravations of an ideal modelled upon the infinite.
But the general rule holds good, in regard both to
bodily and mental laws, for the mass of the Olympian
Court.</p>

<p>Thus deities are subject to sleep, both ordinarily, and
under the special influences of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὕπνος</span>, the god of sleep.
We are furnished with a reason for Jupiter’s not being
asleep at a given moment<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>; it is the special anxiety
which presses on him. He had been asleep just before.
Their bodies are not ethereal, but are capable of constraint
by manacles. They are capable also of wounds;
and they suffer pain even so as to scream under it:
but their blood is ichor, and their hurts heal with
great rapidity<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>. They eat ambrosia, and drink nectar.
They also receive a sensible pleasure from the savour
of sacrifices and libations<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>. Nor is this pleasure alone,
it is also nourishment and strength, for Mercury speaks
of it as highly desirable for support on any long journey.
He, too, practises according to his precept, for he
seems greatly to relish the meal of ambrosia and nectar,
which is afforded him by the hospitality of Calypso<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards the percipient organs, the Olympian
gods appear to depend practically on the eye. Minerva
alone has a perfect and unfailing acquaintance with
whatever it concerns her to know. For even Jupiter,
as we have seen, is not exempt from limitation in this
point<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>. Juno sends Iris to Achilles in the Eighteenth
Iliad without his knowledge, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρυβδὰ Διὸς ἄλλων τε
θεῶν</span>. Apollo does not immediately perceive the expedition
of Ulysses and Diomed in the Doloneia. Being
here opposed to Minerva, he could not but be worsted.
Generally, even these great traditive deities perceive
not by a gift of universal vision, but by attention<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>:</p>

       <div class="verse">οὐδ’ ἀλαοσκοπίην εἶχ’ ἀργυρότοξος Ἀπόλλων.</div>

<p>Juno, keenly alive with anxiety, perceives from Olympus
the slaughter that Hector and Mars are making on the
plain of Troy; and likewise from the same spot watches
Jupiter sitting upon Ida<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>. These four deities, Jupiter,
Juno, Minerva, and Apollo, appear to be endowed with
by far the largest range of vision. Even to Neptune
no such powers are assigned, as to them; for we are
never given to understand that any amount of mere
distance is too great for their ken. But Neptune only
sees the state of the battle before Troy by coming to
Samothrace, apparently to bring it within view, and by
looking from thence: nor is the Poet content without
adding the reason;</p>

<p>a passage which seems to imply, that his vision was
much the same as that of mankind even in degree.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>General prevalence of limitation.</i></div>

<p>In the Odyssey, Ulysses pursues his voyage on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
raft without the knowledge of Neptune, although on
the proper domain of the god, until the eighteenth
day. Then he discovers him, but it is only because,
coming up from the Ethiopian country, on reaching
the Solyman mountains, he is supposed to have got
within view of the hero. Being here, without special
directions, in the zone of the Outer Geography, we have
no means of measuring the terrestrial distance with precision,
and the Poet has not informed us what interval
of space he intended us to suppose.</p>

<p>The inventive deities of the second order in Olympus
are very slightly gifted in this matter. So much we perceive
from the ignorance of Mars about the death of his
son Ascalaphus. When Venus observes, that Æneas
has been wounded, Homer does not name the spot
from which she looked; but the general range of the
powers of this divinity is so narrow, that we must suppose
he means to place her immediately over the field
of battle before Troy.</p>

<p>Of the powers of Apollo or Minerva, as hearers of
prayer irrespectively of distance, I have already spoken;
but the local idea enters more freely into the anomalous
character of the head of Olympus. In the First
Iliad, Thetis explains to her son that she cannot introduce
to Jupiter the matter of his wrongs, until he
returns from the country of the Ethiopians, whither he
has repaired with the other Immortals to a banquet<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>.
This may mean either that he is too far off to attend
to the business, or that he must not be disturbed while
inhaling the odours of a hecatomb.</p>

<p>Very great diversity in individual cases, but at the
same time a general and pervading law of restraint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
are evident in the descriptions of the deities with respect
to their powers of locomotion. Facility of movement
accrues to them variously according to 1. their
peculiar work and office; 2. their general dignity and
freedom from merely mythological traits; 3. the exigencies
of the particular situation. As to the first, I
have noticed that Mercury and Iris have a rapidity as
messenger-gods, which in their simple capacity as gods
they could scarcely possess. Yet even Mercury follows
a route: from Olympus he strikes across Pieria,
and next descending skims the surface of the sea;
then at length passes to the beach of the island, and
so onwards to the cave of the Nymph<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>. Minerva, on
the other hand, in virtue not of any special function,
but of her general power and grandeur, is conceived as
swifter still. The journeys of Apollo, in like manner,
are conceived of as instantaneous: the rule in both
cases being subject to poetical exceptions only. The
chariots of Juno and of Neptune<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>, again, proceed with
measured pace. Each step of Juno’s horses covers the
distance over which a man can see<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>. Neptune himself
passes in four steps from Samothrace to Ægæ<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>. The
driving of Jupiter from Olympus to Ida is described in
terms before used for Juno’s journey<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>. Juno travels
at another time from Olympus to Lemnos by Pieria,
Emathia, and the tops of the Thracian mountains. Here
Homer seems to supply her with a sort of made road
on which to tread: for the route is a little circuitous<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>.
Mars, when wounded, takes wing to Olympus: but
Venus, though only hurt in the wrist, cannot get
thither until she obtains the aid of his chariot, which
happily for her was then waiting on the field<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>But poetical utility, so to speak, enters very largely
into the whole subject of Olympian locomotion, and
makes it difficult to draw with rigour the proper mythological
conclusions. This may be sufficiently illustrated
by the following cases. We have seen the
majestic march of Juno from one hill top to another,
and the measured though speedy course of her chariot.
Yet, under the pressure of urgent considerations, she
flies from Ida to Olympus, as the bearer of Jupiter’s
message, with a rapidity that Homer illustrates by the
remarkable simile of the travelling of Thought<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>. Again,
where an imposing magnificence is the object, measure
is introduced into the movement of Apollo himself by
the clang of the darts upon his shoulder as he goes<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>.
And, even more, Venus, whom we have seen so impotent
on the field of Troy, after her exposure in the
Eighth Odyssey, flies at once all the way to Paphos;
as does Mars to Thrace<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>. This in both cases is probably
because the occasion did not admit of ornamental
enlargements, such as befitted the journey of a god.
And when Vulcan is represented as actually engaged in
falling during the whole day from Olympus down into
Lemnus<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>, a poetical allusion to his lameness may probably
be intended.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Chief heads of superiority to mankind.</i></div>

<p>Thus we see not the mental only, but also the corporeal
existence of the mythological god hemmed in
on every side. A great force of appetite, and a disposition
to give it unbridled indulgence, can hardly be
reckoned among elevating gifts. But if it be asked,
wherein does Homer enlarge and improve for his mythical
gods the human conditions of being, besides,</p>

<p>(1.) The one grand point of immortality, I should answer,
in</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>(2.) An unlimited abundance of the means of corporal
enjoyment, and a general freedom from the interruptions
of care.</p>

<p>(3.) A liberal dispensation of the somewhat vulgar
commodities of physical strength and stature; and of
the higher gift of absolute beauty, into which the idea
of stature, however, materially enters.</p>

<p>The former of these two we learn from the fact, that
the banquet is the habitual and normal occupation of
the Olympian Court. In the First Book, the fray between
Jupiter and Juno passes off naturally, and as a
matter of course, into a feast that lasts all day<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>. And
when Juno, in the Fifteenth Book, reaches Olympus with
a message from Jupiter, Thetis, whom she meets first,
salutes her by offering the cup<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>.</p>

<p>There is also among the gods a kind of ‘high life
below stairs.’ When Iris repairs on behalf of Achilles
to the Winds, she finds them too banqueting in the
palace of Zephyr, probably their chief<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>; but she hastes
away, when her message is delivered, to feast in preference
among divinities of her own rank upon an
Ethiopian sacrifice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their stature and beauty.</i></div>

<p>As regards size and stature, these gifts are so freely
bestowed as to be almost without measure: nor does the
Poet even care in such cases to be at strict unity with
himself. Mars, who in the Fifth Book, draws no very
peculiar notice on the battle field from his size, in the
Theomachy, when laid prostrate, covers seven acres.
Eris, treading on the earth, strikes heaven with her
head. The helmet of Minerva would suffice for the
soldiery of a hundred cities; the golden tassels of her
ægis, a hundred in number, and each worth a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
oxen, after every allowance for mere laxity in the use
of numbers, would imply vast weight and bulk. Accordingly,
the axle of Juno’s chariot may well groan
beneath the weight of Pallas<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>. Apollo, without the
smallest seeming effort, stops Diomed and Patroclus in
mid-career; and overthrows the Greek wall as easily
as a child overthrows his plaything heap of sand<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>.
Other signs might be quoted, such as the tread that
shakes the earth, and the voices of Mars and Neptune,
equal to those of nine or ten thousand<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> mortals.</p>

<p>With the one marked exception of Vulcan, beauty
is generally indicated as the characteristic of the Olympian
deities. Among the gods, it extends even to
Mars<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>. It is sufficiently indicated for the goddesses by
their habitual epithets. Even Minerva, in whom personal
charms are as it were eclipsed by the sublime
gifts of the mind, is sometimes called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠΰκομος</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐϋπλόκαμος</span> (Il. vi. 92. Od. vii. 40): and Calypso declares
the superiority of goddesses to women in beauty, as a
general proposition<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent18">ἐπεὶ οὔπως οὐδὲ ἔοικεν</div>
       <div class="verse">θνητὰς ἀθανάτῃσι δέμας καὶ εἶδος ἐρίζειν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The mythological or invented deities generally, but
none of the strictly traditive deities, appear to be
tainted with libertinism. Among the former we may,
however, observe degrees. Jupiter and Venus stand at
the head. Neptune, Mars, Mercury, Ceres, Aurora,
follow. Juno evidently treats the passion simply as an
instrument for political ends. Of this Homer has given
us a very remarkable indication. For when she sees
Jupiter on Ida, though she is just then conceiving her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
design, she views him with disgust: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στυγερὸς δέ οἱ
ἔπλετο θυμῷ</span><a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>. So careful is the Poet that we shall not
imagine her to have been under the gross influence of
a merely sensual passion. Thetis suggests a remedy
of that nature to her son for his grief<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>. In mere
impersonations, not yet endowed with the strong
human individuality of the Greek Olympus, such as
Themis and Helios, we do not expect to find this trait.
But of all the fully personified deities of invention,
Vulcan alone, privileged by Labour and Ugliness, appears
in Homer to be exempt. The Hellenic goddesses
generally do not, however, like the more Pelasgian
Venus, Ceres, and probably Aurora, debase themselves
by intrigues with mortal men.</p>

<p>The chastity of the traditive deities, Minerva, Diana,
Latona, and probably Apollo, I take for one of the
noblest and most significant proofs of the high origin
of the materials which they respectively embody.</p>

<p>There is also in the deities of Homer not merely a
dependance upon physical nourishment, but even a
passion of gluttony connected with it. The basis of this
idea is laid in the conception which made feasting the
normal occupation of Olympus. It followed that they
were not only bound by something in the nature of
necessity to food, but also enslaved to it by greediness
as a rooted habit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nature of their regard for sacrifice.</i></div>

<p>Of this we find traces all through the poems, in the
course which divine favour usually takes. When Homer
speaks of the gods in the sense of Providential
governors, it is the just man that they regard, and the
unjust that they visit with wrath. But when he carries
us into Olympus, and we behold them in the living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
energy of their individualities, it is sacrifice which they
want, and which forms their share in the fruits of earth
and of human labour, as we learn from the emphatic
words of Jupiter himself;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">τὸ γὰρ λάχομεν γέρας ἡμεῖς<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was the bounty of Autolycus in lambs and kids
which induced Mercury to bestow on him in return the
gifts of thievery and perjury<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>.</p>

<p>Moral retribution in Homer lags and limps at a
great distance behind the offence, but the omission to
sacrifice is visited condignly and at once. Again, in the
case of Troy, liberality in this particular even seems to
create a party in Olympus on behalf of an offending
race. On the erection of the rampart by the Greeks,
Neptune immediately urges the omission of the regular
hecatombs against them. It is punished by Diana in
Ætolia, by the gods generally on the departure from
Troas; and Menelaus in like manner is for this offence
wind-bound in Pharos<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>.</p>

<p>The reason of this preeminence of sacrifices, both as
to punishment and as to reward, may lie partly in the
tendency of man (though, as we shall presently see,
the practice had its moral side also) to substitute
positive observances for moral obedience; but partly,
likewise, in the importance of sacrifices to the anthropophuism
of the Olympian deities themselves.</p>

<p>Putting out of view what each deity can do in his
particular domain, we shall find that but little of
power over nature&mdash;whether human, animal, or inanimate&mdash;attaches
to the Homeric gods as such. Juno
conveys a suggestion to the mind of Agamemnon<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>,
and gives, with Minerva, courage to a warrior; but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
is the whole of her immediate action, I mean action
without a mean, in this department, exhibited by any
passage in the Poems. Indeed, no other mythological
deity ascends to agency of this kind at all.</p>

<p>Upon animal and inanimate nature Juno exercises
the highest powers. When she thunders with Minerva,
sends cloud to impede the flying Trojans, retards the
sunset, and assists the voyage of Jason, we may consider
her as in the reflex use of the atmospheric
powers of her husband: but the gift of a voice to
the horse Xanthus, apparently can lie within her reach
only by derivation from the higher or traditive element
in his character, as representing the idea of supreme
deity.</p>

<p>Among the deities of invention, the general rule is,
with respect to the exercise of power over nature or
the human mind, that it is confined to matters in immediate
connection with their several specialties. Two
extraordinary acts of power over nature appear, however,
to be within the competency of them all. One
is the production of a patch of cloud or vapour at will;
the other is that of assuming the human form for
themselves, either generally or in the likeness of some
particular person. I do not, however, recollect any instance
in which this power is exercised by a deity of
invention in the manner in which Minerva employs it
in the First Iliad<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>, that is, under the condition of being
visible only to one person out of many who are present.
In that image we seem to find a figure, perhaps
a traditionary remnant, of that inward and personal
communication between the Almighty and the individual
soul, which constitutes a high distinguishing note
of the true religion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>There would appear to have been certain visible
marks which went to distinguish a god, up to a certain
point, from men. Hector in the Fifteenth Iliad knows
Apollo to be a god<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>, but does not know what god.
Minerva clears the vision of Diomed, that he may
be able to discriminate between gods and men<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>.
Pandarus, eyeing Diomed, is uncertain whether he is a
mortal or a god<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>. The recognition of Venus by Helen
may, indeed, have been due to the imperfectness of her
power of self-transformation<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>; but it may also have
been owing to these general traces of resemblance
to the divine order, which subsisted even under the
human disguise.</p>

<p>Homer represents Minerva as weighing down the
chariot of Diomed, and making the axle creak<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent14">μέγα δ’ ἔβραχε φήγινος ἄξων</div>
       <div class="verse">βριθοσύνῃ· δεινὴν γὰρ ἄγεν θεὸν, ἄνδρα τ’ ἄριστον.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This passage may be taken as a proof, since it applies
to the most spiritual of the Homeric divinities, how far
the Poet was from considering that they were endowed
with the properties of pure spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Parts of the body, how ascribed.</i></div>

<p>Of this he has given us farther proof by his free and
constant reference, wherever occasion serves, to the
parts and organs of the body as appertaining to the
gods.</p>

<p>I think that references of this kind in Holy Scripture
usually bear a mark, which yields decisive witness to
the fact that their use is wholly relative and analogical:
as, for example, the eye of God, namely, the instrument
by which He watches us, the mouth of God, by which
He instructs us, the hand and the arm of God, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
which He sustains, or delivers, or corrects, or crushes
us. It does not therefore appear that we could justly
and fully draw our conclusions as to the corporeal constitution
of an Olympic deity from the mere circumstance
that we are told of the knees or lap of the gods,
by which it might be figuratively expressed, that the
disposal of human affairs rests with them<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>; or because
of that gorgeous description, which the Poet has given
us, of the head and nod, meaning the decree of Jupiter.
For all these allusions are capable of explanation on
the same principle with those of Holy Scripture,
namely, as being relative and explanatory to man.</p>

<p>But he has a multitude of other references to parts
of the body, which do not at all belong to the use of
them as organs for communication with the imperfect
apprehensions of mankind. Thus:</p>

<p>1. Thetis takes hold of the chin of Jupiter, Il. i. 501.</p>

<p>2. Diomed wounds Venus on the wrist, Il. v. 336.</p>

<p>3. And Mars in the abdomen, Il. v. 857; whom
Minerva likewise overthrows by a blow on the neck,
Il. xxi. 406.</p>

<p>4. Hercules wounds Juno in the right breast, Il. v.
393; and we have her hair, flesh, chest, and feet, in
the toilette of Il. xiv. 170&ndash;86.</p>

<p>5. Helen discovers the neck and breast as well as
eyes of Venus, Il. iii. 396. See Il. xxi. 424.</p>

<p>6. The legs of Vulcan are weak, his neck strong,
and his chest shaggy, Il. xviii. 411&ndash;15.</p>

<p>7. Mercury attaches wings to his feet, Od. v.</p>

<p>8. Juno seizes the wrists of Diana, takes the bow
and arrows from her back, and beats her about the
ears, Il. xxi. 489&ndash;91.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>
<p>9. The arrows rattle on the shoulder of Apollo,
Il. i. 46.</p>

<p>10. The arming of Minerva introduces her shoulders,
head, and feet, Il. v. 738&ndash;45.</p>

<p>We need not, however, be surprised at failing to
find in Homer any conception approaching to that of
pure spirit, or any thing resembling that refined discernment,
which has led Christian Art to represent the
figure of our Lord alone as self-poised and self-supported
in the air, while all other human forms, even
when transfigured, have a ground beneath their feet,
though it be but made of cloud. Even in some of the
very highest among Christian writers, such as Dante
and St. Bernard, the human being, after the soul has
gone through dismissal from the flesh, still appears to
be invested with a lighter form and species of body,
apparently on the assumption that the two elements of
matter and spirit are not only essentially, but inseparably
wedded in our nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Examples of miracle in Homer.</i></div>

<p>Full as they are of preternatural signs and operations,
the poems of Homer do not, nevertheless, deal much
with miracle, with the specific purpose of which he
had no concern.</p>

<p>By miracle I understand, speaking generally, not the
mere use of the common natural powers, accumulated
or enlarged, but an operation involving what, I suppose,
would be called medically an organic departure from
her customary laws: an operation too, which must absolutely
be performed, upon man himself or some other
object, after some manner which shall be appreciable
in its results by his faculties, and calculated to satisfy
them, when in their greatest vigilance, that it is a real
experience, and not a mere delusion of the senses.</p>

<p>Thus understood, the miracles of Homer are, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>

Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>, Od. xiii. 398, 429, and xxiii. 156&ndash;63.</p>

<p>The first seems due to the divine power as a whole;
the second and fourth to Juno; the third and seventh
and eighth to Minerva; the fifth and sixth are the
works of Apollo; the ninth and tenth of Jupiter. I
do not add as an eleventh the conversion of the
Phæacian ship into a rock, by Neptune, in the sight of
the people; because this is rather of the class of
marvels which appertained to other, even secondary
gods, such as Vulcan, in their own particular domains,
Od. xiii. 159&ndash;87.</p>

<p>The buoyant arms of Achilles (Il. xix. 386), and other
works of Vulcan, might at first sight seem to belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
to the list, but it is doubtful whether they are not
poetical rather than mythological representations, and
in any case they would appear as gifts strictly professional,
exercised in the ordinary administration of his
peculiar function.</p>

<p>Telemachus appears to recognise the existence of
miraculous powers in the passage<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>,</p>

<p>But this is spoken of the Godhead rather than of any
particular deity, and cannot by Homeric analogy be
applied except to those of the highest natures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their operation on the human mind.</i></div>

<p>It will however be observed, that several of these
prodigies are not stated to have challenged human observation
when performed: and unless they submit
themselves to the test of the senses they are not properly
miracles at all. Others of them entirely comply
with the condition, as especially that of Il. ii. 320.</p>

<p>The retardation of sunset and sunrise, and the rain
of blood, appear to pass wholly unobserved. Prodigies
not setting out from a basis in nature, such as the
tears of blood shed by Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>, are wholly beyond the
scope of these observations.</p>

<p>On the whole, we find stringent limitation prevailing
in this province, as regards the majority of the gods.</p>

<p>Indeed the forces of nature, which the mythological
divinities in part represent, were sometimes too strong
for them: for Homer tells us that Notus and Zephyr<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>
sometimes shatter vessels at sea without or against the
will of the gods:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">θεῶν ἀέκητι ἀνάκτων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Even man, and that without impiety, can occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>ally
think of resistance. When Menelaus, alone in the
field, decides on retiring before Hector (who fights <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκ
θεόφιν</span>), rather than contend <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρὸς δαίμονα</span>, he looks
around for Ajax, and observes that, could he but see
him, they two would fight <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καὶ πρὸς δαίμονά περ</span>, even
with the deity opposed to them, in order to recover the
body of Patroclus<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>.</p>

<p>There is, however, I think, another reason, besides
feebleness in his conception of the gods, which prevents
the Greek Poet from representing them as omnipotent
in regard to the operations of the human mind;
and that is, his profound sense of the free agency of man.
This principle with him, as it were, confronts the deity
on every side; who respects its dignity, and never really
invades its sphere, but pursues his work by means compatible
with its essential character. The idea of the deity
pervading the poems is mainly that of a cooperative
power, who helps us when and as we help ourselves. It
is expressed with an unrivalled simplicity when Telemachus,
coming as a young man into the presence of
Nestor, feels oppressed with a nervous shyness; and
Minerva encourages him by telling him that he can of
himself find something to say, and that the divinity will
prompt more to him<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Heavenly influence never overpowers or suppresses the
will, but sometimes suggests thoughts to the mind,
and sometimes diverts it, not perhaps from the thought
of an object already perceived, but from the chance of
perceiving it. Thus, when Euryclea, through surprise
on beholding the scar, and so recognising Ulysses, oversets
the foot-bath, Penelope, who is present, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
naturally have observed the miscarriage; but Minerva
interposes to abstract her attention from what was passing,
lest she should recognise her husband prematurely:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἡ δ’ οὔτ’ ἀθρῆσαι δύνατ’ ἀντίη, οὔτε νοῆσαι,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>With the exception of Juno, who in some sense reflects
the majesty of Jupiter, and becomes entitled as a
wife to handle his prerogatives, it may be stated generally
respecting the deities of invention properly so
called, that, except within the limits of their particular
domain or office, they scarcely at all modify the laws of
nature, never set in motion or direct her greater forces,
nor act in an extraordinary manner on the mind or
body of man. Each in his own province can stimulate
a particular animal propensity, or improve a particular
gift of mind or body: and that is all.</p>

<p>While therefore the strength of the Olympian deities
lies in knowledge and in power, we find upon the
whole that even in these particularly they are subject to
manifold limitation. They could translate mortals out
of this world in which the rule of Death prevails, as
we see in the cases of Ganymede, and of Tithonus; but
it does not appear that, if we except the traditive ideas
represented in Minerva and Apollo, they could either
raise men from the grave, prevent their dying in the
course of nature, heal their wounds or diseases, or set
their broken limbs. When even Latona and Diana heal
Æneas<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>, they do it apparently with greater speed indeed,
but in other respects much as it would have been
done by Podaleirius or Machaon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>They do not discern the thoughts.</i></div>

<p>Nor, again, does it appear that even the most exalted
of their number had the knowledge of inward
thoughts, otherwise than as they may be discovered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
persons of particular sagacity. When Minerva detects
the false accounts given of himself by Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>, no
more is declared than the simple fact that she has a
sufficient knowledge of his personal identity. Hence,
with respect to the fraud of Laomedon upon Neptune
and Apollo, Saint Augustine sarcastically wonders that
even Apollo the diviner should not have known that
Laomedon meant to cheat him<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>; and that one of such
dignity as Neptune should have been in a like state of
ignorance. With this we may compare the taunts of
Elijah<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> against the priests of Baal.</p>

<p>While, then, the gift of anything like general foreknowledge
appears to be withheld from all the deities
of invention, that of the ‘discerner of the thoughts and
intents of the heart,’ is nowhere found; nor was it believed
of any member of the Olympian community, as
it was said of One greater than they<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>: ‘He knew all
men; and needed not that any should testify of man,
for he knew what was in man.’</p>

<p>Such, as far as I am able to present it, is the
internal view of the Olympus of Homer: a scheme
eminently national, and eminently poetical. Egypt,
Persia, Phœnicia, the old Pelasgians, doubtless contributed
materials towards its formation: but I have a
lively conviction that Homer was (so to speak) the theo-mythologer
who moulded these materials into system,
the substitute for unity, invested them with the forms
and colours of brilliant beauty, and gave them their
hold in their historic shape upon the mind of his
countrymen; with the sublime Olympus, so near the old
Dodona, of which he probably contrived it as the rival,
for their centre of life and power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">SECT. VI.<br />

<i>The Olympian Community and its Members, considered
in their influence on human society and conduct.</i></h2></div>

<p>We have thus far considered the deities of Homer
as they are, or are represented by him to be, in themselves
individually, and in their mutual relations. We
have now to consider the relation which subsisted between
them and the race of man, especially on its
human side; the state of religious sentiment and obligation,
and of the moral law, both as towards heaven
and likewise as between man and man, so far as it is
immediately associated with the system of which they
are the representatives. Another large part of morals,
which was already in great part detached from visible
relation to religion, will remain for separate consideration.</p>

<p>And here we may remark, that the Homeric Greeks
apparently knew nothing of any periodical religious
observance of commanding authority, such as to form
a centre either for national union, or for the life of the
individual. Had there been such an observance, we
must, without doubt, have found a trace of it on the
Shield of Achilles. The only festival, of which we have
clear information, is that of Apollo in the Odyssey, on
the first day of the month. More obscurely, one of
Minerva appears to be indicated in Il. ii. 551. No religious
worship, properly to be so called, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
the funeral of Patroclus, or the games which followed
it. The Winds<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> were called in aid for a special purpose.
The invocation of Spercheus<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> is an apology for
devoting to Patroclus the hair which Peleus had, on
his son’s behalf, vowed to that River-god. Neither is
there any notice whatever of religion in the brief summary
of the proceedings in Troy after the ransom of
the corpse of Hector<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>.</p>

<p>But although not sustained or organized by the
self-acting machinery of periodical celebrations, nor by
the appropriation of the services of a particular class
of society, the life, thoughts, and actions of the better
Greeks were in a close and pervading proximity, so to
speak, to their religion. I say of the better Greeks;
for there is an almost total absence of reference to the
gods in the language, as well as in the actions, of the
profligate Suitors of the Odyssey. When it first appears,
it is ironical<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>: and only in the last distress does
it assume any other character.</p>

<p>In general terms, every thing was ascribed to the
gods. They know all things, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ δέ τε πάντα ἴσασιν</span><a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>:
They can do every thing, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ δέ τε πάντα δύνανται</span><a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>;
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δύναται γὰρ ἅπαντα</span><a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> is said of Jupiter, in the character
of Providence. They are the givers of all blessings,
mental as well as corporal<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>; the disposers of
events; the ordainers, or even authors of calamities.
They are said also to do for us what we ourselves have
done for ourselves; as where Ulysses tells Eumæus, that
the gods broke his bonds, and the gods hid him<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>; acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
which he himself had performed. Also what they effect,
they commonly effect with ease, as in both the last-mentioned
cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Religion was still a real power.</i></div>

<p>However faulty, and however feeble, the religion of
the Greeks had not yet ceased to be a religion; for it
was believed in. Men might resent or fear the communications
made to them on the part of the deity;
but they did not venture to repudiate their authority.</p>

<p>In Homer, except with the dissolute Suitors, (Od. ii.
180, 201.) the Seer stands as the faithful exponent
of the will of Heaven; and Agamemnon, even when
smarting under the declarations of Calchas, and reviling
him accordingly in his individual capacity (i. 106),
does not presume to intimate any suspicion that what
he has said is of his own invention. But time passed
on: corruption accumulated, and festered more and
more. Accordingly in Euripides, Agamemnon and
Menelaus seem to speak of the whole class of prophets
as if they deserved no belief. See the Iphigenia in
Aulis, v. 10, 11. So in the same play, vv. 783&ndash;9, the
Chorus speaks of the birth of Helen from Leda and
Jupiter, with the proviso, ‘whether it were true or
whether fabulous.’</p>

<p>Again, we have in the same play, vv. 945&ndash;7:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent14">τίς δὲ μάντις ἔστ’; ἀνὴρ</div>
       <div class="verse">ὃς ὀλίγ’ ἀληθῆ, πολλὰ δὲ ψευδῆ, λέγει,</div>
       <div class="verse">τυχών· ὅταν δὲ μὴ τύχῃ, διοίχεται.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The mind of man had travelled far onward in its
career, and great changes had passed upon his moral
tone, before the place of the Prophet, in the estimation
of the public, could be so strikingly reversed as we find
from these quotations.</p>

<p>In the Homeric age, religion was a real power; and the
veneration paid to deity extended so far, at least, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
persons of its ministers, that scarce any human thought
could conceive the possibility of their falsifying the
awful communications of which they were the vehicles.</p>

<p>But it will be replied, if religion was a power, if
whatever it covered with its mantle was accepted and
held in honour, then what a deluge of corruption must
have spread over Greece from a religion of which
Jupiter was the head, and which had Venus for one of
its recognised divinities!</p>

<p>Now the age of Homer shows us the religion of
Olympus in a state, in which it had not yet become
sufficiently the object of scrutiny to suggest, on a large
scale, either the depraved imitation which was to be
its too speedy result, or the unbelief which formed, in
the moral chain of cause and effect, its necessary consummation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Corruptions of the gods not yet fully felt.</i></div>

<p>In fact, we do not find that the corrupting influence
of the Greek mythology on manners had been fully felt
in the time of Homer. Though vices are in particular
cases represented as the gifts of particular deities to
particular individuals, it does not appear that these
were yet regarded as examples for general imitation<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>.
But the beginnings of mischief, so vigorous and abundant,
did not fail in time to produce their fruit: and
in the historic ages of Greece, the models supplied by
the conduct of deities were freely pleaded in defence of
debauchery and crime<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>.</p>

<p>This is in conformity with ordinary experience. The
vices of the great are first passed by, as if it were profane
to suffer the eye to rest upon them; then they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
regarded for a time with depraved admiration; and
when the last stage is reached, they are too faithfully
copied by the small.</p>

<p>It was hardly possible that men could be effectually
swayed for a length of time by the moral government
of deities, themselves privileged by human invention
for unbounded immorality: but it was naturally the
first stage of the destructive process to vitiate the character
of the gods, and the next and later one to break
down the credit of their administration of human
affairs, which only became incredible even to the enlightened
part of the community after their moral
worthlessness had been fully and long developed.</p>

<p>The Homeric poems expose to our view two standards
not mutually accordant, the objective and the
subjective. If we pay attention to the impressions
current among men respecting the gods, they are the
guardians of some moral and social principles of the
highest order. But if we take their own word for it,
the mere Olympian deities seem ordinarily to appreciate
no quality or conduct, except the practice of
offering up numerous and well fed animals in sacrifice,
each with the accompanying tribute of the appointed
portion; that so they may draw, not a moral but a physical,
though a comparatively refined, gratification from
the savour and the taste<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>.</p>

<p>The protection, too, which the deities usually accord
to man, is not only given on selfish principles, but is
liable to be withdrawn for causes wholly independent
of his deserts. Quarrels about men are settled, not by
each foregoing his animosities, but by each surrendering
and abandoning his clients. ‘I will give up Troy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
you,’ says Jupiter; ‘but mind that I shall be at liberty to
destroy the cities which you love, when I may be so
minded<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>.’ ‘You are quite welcome,’ answers Juno,
‘and indeed I could not prevent you: but let me have
Troy destroyed.’ Why, says even Apollo to Neptune,
should we quarrel about miserable mortals? It is not
worth our while: let us leave them to themselves<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>.
No Homeric deity ever will be found to make a personal
sacrifice on behalf of a human client.</p>

<p>In the next Section, I shall endeavour to show that
the practice of sacrifice was not so entirely disconnected
from morality, as we are perhaps too apt to suppose. I
think we may, on the contrary, find in it at least a witness
to the essential harmony between morality and
divine worship, and to the difficulty of tearing them
asunder.</p>

<p>We are here met, indeed, by the case of Autolycus,
which proves to us that the better elements of this
practice were already on their way to corruption, inasmuch
as in that instance they had reached it. It was a
case, let it be remembered, of sacrifices, not to the gods
in general, nor to the higher or the better deities, but
to Mercury, a purely mythical divinity; and therefore
what we see in it is, a false religion in a state of ripeness
at one particular point. Now the worship of Mercury,
the god of gain, was perhaps the first point at which the
morality of the system might be expected to give way:
and it is therefore quite in the natural course that a
case like that of Autolycus should be presented to us
without any corresponding case for any other deity<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>.
As it stands in Homer, it represents what was then the
exception, though it was gradually to become the rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>A moral tone occasionally perceptible.</i></div>

<p>There are, however, in particular connection with
one of the great traditive deities, glimpses of better
things, even in Olympus. When urged by Minerva on
behalf of Ulysses in the Odyssey, Jupiter half rebukes
her for having insinuated a doubt, by replying, ‘How
could I forget Ulysses, who excels others both in his
intellect, and in the sacrifices which he offers to the
gods?’<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>It may indeed be said that in this passage, if it be
construed strictly, it is mental power or intelligence,
and not any moral quality, which, as second to liberality
in sacrifice, is recognised as fit to be taken into account
by the gods.</p>

<p>Still it is, I think, manifest that Homer, like the
Holy Scripture, includes a moral element in the idea
of wisdom, which is represented by the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόος</span>, commonly
or always used of men in a good sense.</p>

<p>And in the second divine Council of the Odyssey,
the moral tone rises higher. Minerva, grown more
daring, pleads plainly the discouraging effect which the
indifference of the gods, if continued, will have upon
the moral conduct of sovereigns. ‘Let them,’ she
says, ‘cast away all moral restraint: for the virtuous
Ulysses is forgotten by his people, and is detained in
great affliction by Calypso<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>.’</p>

<p>For us, in the present inquiry, the main question
evidently is, not what are the sentiments which the
Poet has represented as proceeding from his divinities
on Olympus, but what are those which the people at
large believed them to entertain. There is a considerable
difference between these two standards: and it is
the latter one by which we have now to abide.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Prevalent belief concerning them.</i></div>

<p>The deities of Homer, thus measured, are susceptible
of various forms of sentiment in contemplating the
fortunes and deeds of men.</p>

<p>1. In general, they regard virtue and obedience
with approbation.</p>

<p>2. They regard crime with dissatisfaction and a disposition
to punish it.</p>

<p>3. But they also observe any excess, or marked continuity,
of good fortune in the virtuous man with a
kind of envy: as if they could not permit the human
race, on any conditions, to attain to a prosperity or
abundance which should have any semblance of rivalling
their own.</p>

<p>As respects the first, it is indeed a pale and feeble
sentiment; but still it exists. They listen readily to
those who obey them<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>. Prayer appeases them, as well
as sacrifice<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>. They love not perverse deeds like those
of the Suitors, but they honour justice and righteousness<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>.
Upon the whole it may be observed, that much
more just and elevated sentiments are predicated of
the gods as a body, than when they appear as individuals.
For it is as a body that they still retain a
certain relation to true Godhead.</p>

<p>As respects the second proposition, they wander in
disguise to examine the conduct of men<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>. A man
who is hardly used may become to his oppressor a
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεῶν μήνιμα</span>, an occasion of divine vengeance. They
view iniquity with a sentiment sometimes called by
Homer <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄπις</span>, an after-regard that remembers and avenges
it. For this <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄπις</span> the wicked do not care<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>, and such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
indifference is a chief sign of their depravity. Especially
they watch, backed by the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span>, over wrongs
done to the poor<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>; and Jupiter interferes by storm
and flood to testify his displeasure at unrighteous
governors, who administer crooked judgments<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>. Ægisthus
is warned and punished by them. It is Minerva
who plans the vengeance upon the Suitors<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>. At the
same time, revenge for affronts is a much more powerful
and common motive with them, than zeal for the
administration of justice. The latter is lazy and
doubtful; but their sentiments in regard to the former
are of keen edge, and have an irrepressible promptitude
and activity.</p>

<p>As respects the third point, the gods grudged to
Ulysses and Penelope an unbroken continuance of the
blessings of their domestic life<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>. It is in like manner,
as it would seem, that, after a long course of prosperity,
the gallant and good Bellerophon became odious, on
account of his good fortune only, to the gods<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>. And
this same idea is perhaps the groundwork of the alternative
destinies of Achilles, either a long life without
great glory, or transcendent glory and a short career<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>.</p>

<p>While in the later stages of heathen religion the
former and nobler ideas gradually lost ground, this less
worthy one became more and more pronounced; and
Solon, in Herodotus, describes himself as knowing <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ
θεῖον πᾶν ἐὸν φθονερόν τε καὶ ταραχῶδες</span><a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>.</p>

<p>In vague and general terms, the gods of Homer are
represented as givers of blessings, particularly of ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>ternal
goods. Sometimes they are rashly and wildly
charged as the authors of calamities<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>, which the folly
of man himself has caused. But according to the
more grave and serious teaching of the day, they were
conceived to enforce, as against mortals, laws from
which they were certainly themselves exempt; and
allow to mankind no alternative, except that of mixed
good or else unmixed evil. Two caskets stand upon
the floor by Jupiter: one of them is filled with wretchedness
and shame; the other is vicissitude, which oscillates
incessantly between prosperity and sorrow. And
there rankles in the mind of mankind a sentiment,
which tells them that the gods, while they thus dispense
afflictions upon earth which are neither sweetened
by love, nor elevated by a distinct disciplinary
purpose, take care to keep themselves beyond all touch
of grief or care<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὣς γὰρ ἐπεκλώσαντο θεοὶ δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσι,</div>

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>It lent considerable support to virtue.</i></div>

<p>The best thing that can be said for their fainthearted
encouragement to virtue is, that the good man is certainly
understood in most cases, though not always, to
prosper in the end: let us take, for example, Nestor,
Menelaus, or Ulysses. Ajax and Agamemnon meet
unhappy ends; but Ajax was stern and sullen, while
Agamemnon cannot be acquitted of cupidity and selfishness.
On the other hand, as punishers of wrong,
the gods of Olympus do not visit all wrongs and all
vices alike. Especially they take little notice, in their
moral government as in their lives, of the law of purity:
there is no express notice of their displeasure against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the crime of Paris; and Jupiter, the guardian of the
judgment seat, the friend of the suppliant, the stranger,
and the poor, makes no pretension to defend the marriage
bed from the contamination he had himself so often
wrought. However, in a very aggravated instance,
namely, that of Ægisthus, his adulterous marriage with
Clytemnestra<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> is noticed explicitly in the Olympian
Council, as contributing to the enormity of his offence.
But in such a case many other elements, besides that
of purity, are involved: the whole social and political
order of the world is at stake.</p>

<p>Thus upon the whole there was but little more in the
sentiments than in the conduct of the Immortals, to
maintain among men a sense of piety towards Heaven.
Yet a good deal of authority and support were lent to
important principles of relative duty, by the belief that
the deities would or might avenge its infraction. We
must in short fully embrace the fact that man, as represented
in Homer, was inconsistent with respect to
his religion, in the sense opposite to that in which inconsistency
commonly affects that relation. He had
more still remaining in him of ancient and natural morality,
than his belief could either adequately account
for in theory, or permanently sustain in action.</p>

<p>It should at the same time be borne in mind, that,
while the vices of Olympus appertain to the individual
deities, its obscure and qualified virtues, in the championship
of duty, and the avenging of crime upon earth,
are not the properties of this or that mythological impersonation,
but either of the deities considered as a
whole with one united will, or else of those among
them in whose characters Homer still enables us to
read the vestiges of primitive tradition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Their course with respect to Troy.</i></div>

<p>Saint Augustine observes<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>, that some defenders of
the Pagan mythology in later times quoted the fall of
Troy as an instance of Divine retribution coming upon
the descendants of Laomedon for his perjury, and some,
to the same effect, as a punishment of the adultery
committed by Paris. To which he replies truly, that
the heathen deities had no right to punish in Paris an
act which had the sanction of Venus, as she bore Æneas
to Anchises, and of Mars as the father of Romulus:
Æneas and Romulus being the two great reputed
fountain-heads of the highest Roman lineage.</p>

<p>Now, though Homer has practically represented the
gods as avenging the pollution of the nuptial bed, it may
be observed that he nowhere seems to put prominently
forward the adultery of Paris as the main gist of his
offence. In fact, the idea of adultery is very much
absorbed, as we shall see, according to the poems, in
the act of violent abduction. The Greeks on their side,
with the single exception of Menelaus himself, treat
Paris as a robber, or else a coward; not as one who
had, like Ægisthus with Clytemnestra, corrupted the
wife of one of their princes. And so Hector is, I
think, not quite accurately criticized by Mure<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> for
failing to find fault with Paris on the ground of adultery.
Hector does reproach his brother for having
abused the friendly intercourse of life to carry off
another man’s wife, and then not having the courage
to meet the husband in the field. This seems to me in
perfect keeping with the ideas of the time, especially if
I am right in the view, which I shall endeavour to
sustain by argument, that Hector himself is not the
elder, but the younger brother of the two. What did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
the Greeks aim at avenging? Not, we shall find, the
wrong done to Menelaus in his conjugal character, but
the sorrows and sufferings of Helen were evidently the
prominent and conspicuous idea in the mind of the Poet,
and in the mind, as he represents it, of the Greeks. So
that, while Menelaus himself is the only person who in
the Iliad shows a resentment of his own conjugal wrongs,
the Greeks appear to think partly of Helen, partly of
their nation’s honour, partly of their allegiance to the
Pelopids; and partly, perhaps chiefly, of the booty
which, in requital of their arduous labours, they are to
gain upon the sack of Troy<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>.</p>

<p>The defence, therefore, of the heathen deities which
St. Augustine notices as having been put forward, was
a late afterthought. The Poet appears indeed to treat
the lustful effeminacy of Paris in general with a grave
and marked contempt; but this is rather his own personal
sentiment, than a result directly connected with
his religious belief or system. And, more at large, I do
not find it clear that in any place of the Poems any
deity appears, either as the guardian of purity, or as
the avenger of its infraction. Under these circumstances
we shall have the more cause to wonder, that
that virtue could still have been held, as it was held,
by Homer and the Greeks, in partial but evidently real
admiration.</p>

<p>Although retribution was limited to public and
social sins, and did not touch the inner and finer parts
of human conduct, it is not difficult to trace the
advantages which flowed from that sensible remainder
of religion which still subsisted in the Heroic age; not
from those parts of the system which were due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
human invention, but from the elements which it still
contained of the ancient theism, and which invention
had not yet wholly smothered.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, it was thought that the anger of
the gods might be brought down upon a country by
the misconduct of its governors<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">οἳ βίῃ εἰν ἀγορῇ σκολιὰς κρίνωσι θέμιστας·</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and the fear of the temporal calamities thus to be
incurred would, naturally, tend to the maintenance of
integrity in the administration of justice.</p>

<p>As between governors and governed, so between
rich and poor. We cannot doubt that the worthy
Eumæus expresses the general sentiment of his age,
when, having been reproached by the haughty Suitor
Antinous with having invited a beggar into the palace of
Ulysses, he answers, not by denial, but by showing that
the idea is self-condemned by its absurdity. Those
indeed, he replies, may be solicited to come to a house
who exercise the agreeable or the useful professions;
the Seer, the Doctor, the Artificer, the Bard, these are
the people who get invited all over the world;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">πτωχὸν δ’ οὐκ ἄν τις καλέοι, τρύξοντα ἓ αὐτόν;</div>

       <div class="verse">Who would be such a fool as to invite a beggar?<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>With this standard of sentiment, not peculiar to
that age, except in the simple frankness with which it
is avowed, it was surely of the utmost importance for
the needy and afflicted, that they should be placed by
the popular belief in the special charge of the deity;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent18">πρὸς γὰρ Διός εἰσιν ἅπαντες</div>
       <div class="verse">ξεῖνοί τε πτωχοί τε.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So that, though none would invite them, yet few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
would take the responsibility of rejecting their supplications
for what was needful to supply their wants.</p>

<p>And the standing distinction in the Odyssey between
a virtuous and a vicious people is, that the former
is insolent, fierce, and unrighteous, while the latter is
kind to strangers and of god-fearing mind<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>;</p>

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bearing of the religion on social ties.</i></div>

<p>It was thus a clear fact in the heroic age, that
religious belief was a foundation and support to the
exercise of charitable offices between man and man.
I think we may further assert, that it is a fact of all
time; that in all ages and countries the strength and
liveliness of belief in God is a measure which determines
the aggregate amount and activity of mutual love.
Hence, as the Olympian religion became more and more
hollow, public oppression increased, and private charity
and hospitality declined. Yet, even in its most corrupt
and decrepit period, it was on the steps of temples that
the congregations of mendicants assembled; spontaneous
and unconscious witnesses to the fact that, next to God
their Friend in heaven, the reflection of God, however
faint, in the mind of man, is their best friend on earth.
And of the many great social results of Christianity,
one standing in the very foremost rank has been, that
it has for the first time made the rights of the poor
a social axiom, which, though it may in practice be
evaded, none are hardy enough to deny. Perhaps the
very strongest of all the proofs of the connection
between religious belief, and duties to the needy, is to
be found in the instinctive horror which is created in
the minds of men, when a prominent profession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
first is accidentally and occasionally exhibited by persons,
who show a palpable disregard of the second.</p>

<p>Side by side with the powerful obligation, of the indeterminate
species, which binds man to man in the
name of charity or brotherly kindness, stands the corresponding
determinate principle of truth and justice,
which aims at preserving entire to each individual the
definite rights to which he is entitled.</p>

<p>An important part of these definite rights belongs
immediately to the relations between the private person
and the civil power. But the capacity of any
human authority to do justice, even where the will
cannot be found fault with, is of necessity defective:
and no government can do its duties for a day, irrespective
of the aid which each private person renders
to it in reference to every other. Nor is this enough;
it wants, and cannot dispense with, the assistance of an
auxiliary within the breast, in order to guard itself
against delusion, and to secure the requisite conformity
between thought, word, and act. In other words, the
state wants an instrument by which to induce men to
speak the truth.</p>

<p>No such end can be reached by force. Force, in the
shape of torture, will doubtless in the long run avail to
make men asseverate that, be it what it may, by which
they may obtain release from an intolerable suffering.
But the first effect of torture is to make the sufferer
indifferent to the truth or falsehood of his confessions,
so he can but obtain relief by means of them. The
second, and still more detrimental effect, must be to
undermine the very basis of inward truthfulness, and to
create a mental habit of indifference as between what
is true and what is false.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>And on political relations.</i></div>

<p>Hence, the <i>desideratum</i> for the state can only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
found in some power which works in and with the will
of the private person.</p>

<p>It has indeed been argued, and I believe with justice,
that the atheist ought on his own principles to speak
the truth; that is, if he does not shut his eyes to the
testimony borne by the daily experience of life to the
existence of a moral government in the world, even on
this side of the grave. But this supposes, at any rate,
some degree of mental culture; and it is essential to
public order to find the means of operating upon those
who have received no such training.</p>

<p>The question is how to obtain the voluntary disclosure
of truth, in cases where neither interest or inclination
are of themselves sufficient to secure it.</p>

<p>To this question the experience of the world, up to
this time, renders one and but one answer. The requisite
influence may be found, and can only be found,
in an appeal to the Majesty on high, and to the sanctions
of a future life.</p>

<p>Here, then, does the Venerable Oath stand forth in
all its majesty. The act of calling the Deity in the
most solemn of its various forms to witness, has been
found at once to make the word of a man the stoutest
bond of human society: for the perjurer strips himself
of all divine aid<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">οὐ γὰρ ἐπὶ ψευδέσσι πατὴρ Ζεὺς ἔσσετ’ ἀρωγὸς,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and exposes himself to the most terrible penalties<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">εἰ δέ τι τῶνδ’ ἐπίορκον, ἐμοὶ θεοὶ ἄλγεα δοῖεν</div>
       <div class="verse">πολλὰ μάλ’, ὅσσα διδοῦσιν, ὅτις σφ’ ἀλίτηται ὀμόσσας.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Under the operation of the oath, the chances, so to
speak, are doubled in favour of the veracity of the
witness: first, he may not be wicked enough to for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>swear
himself; and secondly, if he is wicked enough,
yet he may not have the requisite amount of daring in
his wickedness.</p>

<p>These views will, I think, receive material confirmation
when we come to consider the relative positions
of the oath in Greece and in Troy. For the present,
I leave the subject with the observation, that four short
words describe the props of human society: they are,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γάμος, ὅρκος, θέμις, θεός</span>.</p>

<p>All these sanctions, however partial and remote,
thus given to human duty by belief in the gods, could
not but be of great practical value.</p>

<p>And indeed it may with truth be said, that the mere
idea of the presence of an overruling power in the
world was of inestimable advantage in repressing human
passion, in moderating desire, and in limiting the
excesses of caprice, wilfulness, and violence.</p>

<p>But it is obvious that these beneficial results from
belief in the gods belonged not to the particular
development, but to the theistical principle which
lay within and under it. The idea of a moral Governor
of the universe was, and ever will be, an unfailing
seed of good wherever it may exist. The Pagan
mythology, at every step of its unfolding into detail,
enfeebled and degraded that great idea, but it could
not be destroyed all at once. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo repente fuit turpissimus</i>;
and a system, like a man, requires time to
reach the extreme of depravation. As, among men, a
judge is not supposed to lose all regard for justice,
because it may be that in some particular of private
life he has transgressed, so the Olympian divinities
might have credit as administrators of moral government,
even after they had begun to be charged with
instances of immorality. But an unscrupulous order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
and succession of judges, would in time put an end to
the idea of public justice; and so the continuing and
growing degradation of the Immortals, in time put an
end to the sense of religion, and made even its fanes<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
smoky, and its pomps contemptible.</p>

<p>And certainly, when we look at the evils, of which
the mythological system was the source, we cannot
but be struck with their overwhelming magnitude, and
with the highly instructive fact, that in every case they
so manifestly belong, not to the original principle of
belief and worship due from man to his Creator, but to
the departure from a pure, and the lapse into an impure
belief.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Moral bearing of the Religion on the poems.</i></div>

<p>The credit for moral results, which has thus been allowed
to the probable operation of the Homeric Theo-mythology
in the world, must be steadily denied to its
influence upon the poems, where it appears before us
as in the main a lowering and corrupting agency. In
fact, the religion and the morality of the Homeric
poems appear to separate, and to run in opposite directions.
The rights of the question at issue, in an ethical
point of view, are plainly with the Greeks: they vindicate
by arms not one only, but two principles, both of
them vital to the order of society, and to individual
happiness and virtue: the sanctity, first, of the family
and of marriage ties; secondly, of the relation created
by the rites of hospitality. And with the rights go the
fortunes of the cause. The capture and fall of Troy
constitute a great triumph of justice over wrong.</p>

<p>But the mythological elements of the question are cast
in a mould entirely different. The royal family of Troy
has been all along in singular favour with the deities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
notwithstanding the perjury of Laomedon; and that
favour does not appear to be in any degree diminished
by the gross and shameful crimes that stand against
Paris in the poem, or by the unfailing and extraordinary
obtuseness of his moral sense. Ganymede, Tithonus,
Anchises, as well as Paris, have all been especial objects
of divine regard. Not only did a full half of the other
deities take part with the Trojans in the war, but Jupiter
himself, apart from his concession to Thetis, was
concerned for them, and says<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>, ‘They interest me even
while they perish’ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέλουσί μοι ὀλλύμενοί περ</span>).</p>

<p>Again, in the meeting of the gods, he describes
Hector<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> as dear to them for his regular and abundant
sacrifices, taking no note whatever of his personal
virtues. Of the three deities who were actively hostile
to Troy, Neptune, Juno, and Minerva, all had personal
causes of offence: the first, the fraud of Laomedon,
which, however, was also an offence against the moral
law; both the others had the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spretæ injuria formæ</i>, and
Juno had also special predilections to gratify. The fall
of Ilios, and the death of Hector, are just: but the
wonder is, with the favourable relations that subsisted
between the Trojans and the father of gods, as well as
men, which were in no respect impaired by crime, how
Hector came to die, or Troy to fall. While the fall of
Troy is justice, it does not seem to come about because
it is agreeable to justice, but rather as the result of the
balance of force among the gods, and of their remembrance
of personal injuries. It appears all along, as
though it were the right-mindedness of the Poet which
keeps the wheels of the machine going, while those
who should be the drivers are at fault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, in the Odyssey, the Providence of the poem,
if we may so speak, is on the side of Virtue; and a
prosperous remainder of life, with a happy death, is
promised to the hero. Of this providence Minerva,
with the approval of Jupiter, is the wise and indefatigable
organ. But while the general idea of providence
moves in the right direction, the polytheistic formations
work powerfully in a wrong one. David and his companions
ate the show-bread in the temple, and were
blameless, because it was to relieve a hunger that they
had no other means of satisfying: but even impending
famine does not excuse or palliate the offence of the
companions of Ulysses, who use for food a portion of
the oxen of the Sun. The jealousy and cruelty of
Neptune, the gifts of Mercury to Autolycus, the savage
crimes of Polyphemus, which do not detract from his
relation to a deity of the highest rank, the disparagement
of the highest human virtues in Calypso, the hostility
to human peace and happiness in Circe and the
Sirens, place the divine life of the Odyssey on a much
lower level than the human and heroic, and to a certain
extent depress by their admixture the sound
ethical tone of the poem. All along, while Homer
luxuriates, poetically, in the abundance and brilliancy
of his materials, he has morally to repair their deficiencies,
and to contend with and overrule their bias.</p>

<p>I cannot therefore but differ greatly from Nitzsch,
who, in his Essay on the Anger of Neptune<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>, seems
to elevate it to the dignity of a providential resentment,
and to conceive of the sufferings of Ulysses as a
punishment for a moral offence in the treatment of
Polyphemus. In this way I grant that a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
parallel is established between his case and the chastisements
which Achilles receives in the Iliad, through
the death of Patroclus, and the surrender of the body
of Hector. Both heroes seem thus to stand upon a
level: both favoured children of the gods, honoured
in the main, but chastised for their faults. But even
this seeming parallelism fails when we remember the
respective sequels. The curtain of the Iliad falls on the
eve of the premature death of Achilles: as that of the
Odyssey is dropping over the head of Ulysses, we perceive,
in perspective, the picture of his serene old age.</p>

<p>As regards the important question of purity, the impression
made on my own mind in reading the poems
of Homer is this: that, but for his mythology, they
would have been unimpeachable, at least in one point
of virtue; they would have been absolutely pure.
Whatever is dissolute in their moral tendency as regards
this particular subject, evidently and directly flows
from that source. We rarely meet a sentiment that can
arouse anything like revulsion: the worst by far that
has struck me is the advice given to Achilles by his
mother Thetis (Il. xxiv. 130), as a mode of solace for
his grief. The narrative of the Net of Vulcan in the
Odyssey is one, that Homer would have been far too
modest to recite with reference to human beings: and
the only other passage, which seems to be marked with
a tinge of grossness, is that which relates to the stratagem
of Juno in the Fourteenth Iliad.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Its bearing as to poetic effect.</i></div>

<p>We may, however, justly distinguish between the
influence of mythology on the morality of the Poems,
and its operation with regard to poetic effect. In this
view the consequences of its introduction, though
mixed, are upon the whole highly favourable. There
is indeed more or less of descent from the usual gran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>deur
of Homer, when we find his deities mingling in
actual conflict: because they never sustain in the field
of battle a part at all corresponding to their celestial
dignity and presumed power. Nor is the Theomachy
proper, in the Twenty-first book of the Iliad, among the
most successful parts of the poem. But the principal
portion of their agency takes effect upon the elements
or other material objects, or upon animals, or upon the
human mind by way of influence and suggestion: and
its tendency is in general to impart interest and variety,
as well as poetic elevation, to the scenery and
narrative. The plot of each epic is worked out simultaneously
in two different forms upon two different
arenas: in Olympus by divine counsel, and on earth
by human effort and execution. Yet no confusion results
from the double action, while the play and counterplay
of the divine and human elements communicate
a remarkable elasticity to the movement of the
poems. Their value is particularly felt in the Iliad,
which, from its limited scene and subject, lies in danger
of the sameness which, by this means among others, it
on the whole escapes. In particular, the relation between
the assisting or patron deities, and the hero or
protagonist of each poem, is conducted with great consistency
and effect: but the most sublime uses of supernatural
machinery to be found throughout the poems are
those in which the traces of it are the most shadowy and
faintly drawn. Take for example the manner in which
Achilles is sent out unarmed to the field, and again, to
the manner of his arming, in the Iliad: in the Odyssey,
the wonderful picture of divine displeasure and
incumbent malediction seeming to gather around and
hem in the Suitors of Penelope, concurrently with the
preparations for human vengeance: as if the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
were too dark for eyes like theirs to catch the true
meaning of these lowering signals, which give a gloomy
but majestic sanction to the terrible swoop of retributive
justice alighting upon crime.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Its earliest and latest forms.</i></div>

<p>It would be most interesting to pursue the comparison
between the believing or credulous infancy of
Paganism as we see it in Homer, and its cold and jealous
decrepitude as we find it in the writers of its
latest period, when the light of the lamp was fading
before the already risen Sun.</p>

<p>In Homer we find the gods offering in their conduct
every sort of example of weakness, passion, and fraud.
But they take an active share in the government of
the world, and men look up to them, collectively or
individually, with more or less of confusion indeed, both
intellectual and moral, but still truly and actually as
exercising some sort of providential government over the
world. The mythology of the time of Homer is a
weak, faulty, and corrupt religion, I admit, but still it is
a religion, a bond which associates man with the unseen
world, and brings some, at least, of its influences
to bear upon his conduct and character. And if the
Greeks of Homer were not shocked by those immoralities
of the Immortals which afterwards came to be
thought intolerable, it was not because they were more
impure than their posterity, for they were far purer: but
the principle of belief in the invisible was in them alike
lively and inconsequent; and it was not yet even conscious
of a load which, in later times, with enfeebled force,
and an augmented critical activity, it could not carry.</p>

<p>In the time of Plutarch, about one hundred years after
our Lord’s nativity, we find the change complete. There
was now no principle of belief in men’s minds which
could endure either the good or the evil of the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
system: and a quickened intelligence, as well as the
streaming in of rays from Revelation, had made the
human intellect more painfully alive to its moral solecisms,
without rendering it able to suggest a remedy.
Accordingly, Plutarch relieves the Homeric deities from
the faults imputed to them by saying, that the Poet has
made use of these fictions to excite the fancy<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκεῖνα
πέπλασται πρὸς ἐκπλῆξιν ἀνθρώπων</span>. Or, again, it was, he
says<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>, because the name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τύχη</span>, Fortune or Chance,
was not yet in use, that men referred to the gods what
they did not know how to account for in any other
manner. Alas for mankind! sad is the state of those,
who must reckon the invention of that name among
their blessings. In the fact, however, that Homer and
his age knew nothing of the word or the idea, he discloses
to us one of the many points in which infancy is
practically wiser than old age. Let us, Plutarch goes on
to say, cure these errors by other passages of the Poet
in which he gives us the truth, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑγιαίνουσαι περὶ θεῶν
δόξαι καὶ ἀληθεῖς</span>: but the passages, which he cites with
this view, are not passages where the deities are represented
as in any active relations of good towards the
world: they are simply those which exhibit them as
living in a repose undisturbed by care, while they leave
for us a destiny of trouble: they are those which relate
to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζώοντες</span>, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐτοὶ δέ τ’ ἀκηδέες εἰσίν</span>.
Stripped of active vice, but yet not adorned with virtue,
they become merely cold and selfish, hopeless and
inaccessible abstractions.</p>

<p>There is in all this a certain logical sequence. The
starting point is that of belief in a moral Governor of
the universe, good himself, and enjoining goodness
upon others. But his own goodness fails, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
agency among men for the original purpose becomes
more and more feeble and equivocal, while the human
intellect, sharpened by discussion, and puffed up with
knowledge, or with the supposition and phantasm of
it, becomes more and more exacting: so that the abstract
gods in Cicero are (without doubt) far more
elevated than the personal gods of Homer. But they
are mere works of art: and, after all, the personal
gods of Homer were the only ones that had been
really worshipped by men: and when their case becomes
so bad that they can no longer be exhibited to
the people as rulers of the world, a refuge is found in
the Epicurean theory, which relegates them to a heaven
of enjoyment and abundance, and on pretence of mental
ease denies them any prerogative of intervention in
human affairs<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>. The gain of more careful and comprehensive
theory is much more than counterbalanced by
the practical loss of the personal element, and therefore
of the belief in a real Providence, overseeing the affairs
of men. So the next onward step is to the doctrine
of the Academicians. In the <i>De Naturâ Deorum</i>,
where that sect is represented by Cotta in the discussion
with the champions of the Epicureans and the
Stoics, Cicero himself, and the ruling tendency, if not
opinion, of his day, are evidently exhibited to us under
Cotta’s name. The transition now made is from gods
with a sinecure to no gods at all: and Paganism ends
in nullity, just as a moving mass finds its final equilibrium
in repose.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Its gloomy view of human destiny.</i></div>

<p>Even while heroic Greece and its great Poet existed,
the deepest problems of our being were far too dark
for man to penetrate. The picture which I have rudely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
drawn, and which is not wholly a joyless picture, was
liable to be blackened, even for this world, by many a
storm of crime and of calamity; at the very best it was a
picture for this world only, for the mortality and not
the immortality of man. But that scene has its close:
and most touching it is to see that, with all his creative
power, with all his imaginative brightness, with all the
advantage he derived from living in the youth of the
world, before mankind had fully sounded the depth of
their own fall, or had begun to accumulate the sad
records of their miseries and crimes; even Homer
could not solve the enigma of our condition, or disperse
the clouds that gathered round our destiny. There
are two profoundly memorable passages in the poems,
which have set their double seal on this truth. One of
them is in the Odyssey: it is a confession from the
mouth of that Achilles, in whose mind and person, as
they are delineated by Homer, our humanity has been
carried perhaps to a higher point of grandeur, than it
has ever since attained. ‘Do not, illustrious Ulysses, do
not palter with me about death,’ says the mournful
shade. ‘Rather would I serve for hire under a master,
aye and a needy master, upon the face of earth, than
be lord of the whole world of the departed<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>:’</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">μὴ δή μοι θάνατόν γε παραύδα, φαίδιμ’ Ὀδυσσεῦ·</div>

<p>A trail of heavenly light indeed so far played upon the
heroic world, that we hear of those few who had already
been translated to the skies; and of two more, one a
son of Jupiter, already in the peaceful Elysian plains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
and the other Menelaus, who, as his daughter’s husband,
was likewise to be carried thither on his decease.
But it is the mouth of Achilles, the illustrious, the
godlike Achilles, which here utters, in tones so deeply
mournful, the common voice of the children of Adam.</p>

<p>It was the very same conclusion which, as we find
in another place<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>, this favoured mortal had formed on
earth.</p>

<p>The second passage is one spoken by Jupiter himself.
As the commonest epithets used by Homer for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βροτοὶ</span>,
mortals, are <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δειλοὶ</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰζυροὶ</span>, so the highest god lays
down the law of their condition, describing it as that
than which there is nothing more wretched among all
that live and move upon the earth<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>:</p>

<p>Such as we have seen, and so glorious, was the wisdom,
and the valour, and the beauty, and the power,
that dwelt in man; but only that through life he
might, upon the whole, be paramount in woe above all
meaner creatures, and then that he might die in a
gloom unrelieved by hope. None have illustrated this
piercing truth by contrasts so sharp as Homer, between
the chill and dismal tone of the general destiny of man
on the one hand, and on the other, the joy and cheerfulness
which the effort of an elastic spirit can for a
time create. But the woe which he could only exhibit,
it was reserved for One greater than he, yet only by
sorrow and suffering, to remove.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The personal belief of Homer.</i></div>

<p>I have forborne in this Essay from entering at large
into the often agitated question, whether Homer believed
in the deities of whom he speaks so largely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
He may express his own childlike creed; and such a
creed by no means requires for its support in the individual
mind, that it should have been visibly represented
by facts within its own experience. Or he
may use as the material of poetry that which, without
approving itself to his own heart, was, nevertheless, to
his hearers in general, a real and substantial system of
religion. Nay, he might even be dealing with what
had ceased to be believed in his day, but had still a
retrospective life, because it had been the hearty, and
was still the conventional, worship of the people. The
truth may lie in, or it may lie between, any of these
suppositions. The one thing of which I feel most
assured is, that he was not, as to his religion, a mere
allegorist when speaking of his Jupiter and Minerva,
any more than he was a mere hypocrite, when he
ascribed occurrences in human life to Providence under
the name of ‘the deity,’ or ‘the deities.’ He represents
what either was or had been, for his people, a
belief in the unseen under particular forms, and what
still in some way represented a reality for them and
for himself. It is this belief of which I have spoken
throughout, and which, under any of the suppositions
I have made, seems to me to warrant all the stress I
have laid upon it.</p>

<p>To attempt a formal solution of the question, whether
he believed or not in the dress of his religion, as well
as in the religion itself, would, I fear, be frivolous.
It is a case in some degree parallel to the disputes
whether Shakspeare adhered, in the controversies of
the sixteenth century, to the side of the Romish or
the Reformed. Neither Shakspeare nor Homer
ought to be judged as if they had been theologians <i>ex
professo</i>. Both followed the law of their sublime art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
and represented in forms of beauty and delight, or of
majesty and gloom, as the case required, such materials
as they found ready to hand. Critical analysis, nice
equipoises, strict definitions, were for neither the one
nor the other. But in the works of neither do the
cold tones of scepticism find an echo: and probably
the mental frame of both with reference to the substance
of their religion may have been not very different
from that of the poor, the maidens, and the
children of their day.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">SECT. VII.<br />

<i>On the traces of an origin abroad for the
Olympian Religion.</i></h2></div>

<p>Let me now attempt to divide the principal deities
of Homer with reference to their origin, or to the
channel of their introduction into Greece; premising,
however, that all such classification of them is admitted
to be founded upon evidence, at best presumptive,
and often also slight.</p>

<p>The classes will be as follows:</p>

<p>1. Of those who were worshipped by the Hellenic
and Pelasgian races, and probably by all others known
in the inner Homeric world.</p>

<p>These were,</p>


<ul><li>1. Jupiter.</li>
<li>2. Minerva.</li>
<li>3. Apollo.</li>
<li>4. Latona.</li>
<li>5. Diana.</li>
<li>6. Neptune.</li>
</ul>

<p>The three first of these may be considered as deities
of immemorial and universal worship. Neptune was
far more Hellenic than Pelasgian: and indeed his place
in the list is doubtful.</p>

<p>2. Of immemorial Hellenic worship.</p>


<ul><li>1. Juno.</li>
<li>2. Persephone.</li>
<li>3. Pluto or Aidoneus.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Of established Pelasgian worship.</p>


<ul><li>1. Demeter or Ceres.</li>
<li>2. Venus, more recent than the former.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>4. Of worship introduced to the Greek races within
the memory of man.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Brought in from Phœnicia, or through the channel
of the Phœnicians.</p>


<ul><li>1. Hermes, or Mercury.</li>
<li>2. Hephæstus, or Vulcan.</li>
<li>3. Dionysus, or Bacchus.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>b.</i> From Thrace.</p>


<ul><li>Mars.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>c.</i> Paieon has no note of country, except in so far
as he may be connected with Egypt by the declaration
that the Egyptians were of his race.</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἠέλιος</span>, the Sun, appears to be placed in connection,
by the various notes he bears, both with Egypt and with
the Persian name.</p>

<p>All these deities were, with some others, more or less
naturalized among the Greeks within Homer’s lifetime.
Themis was probably a pure Hellenic creation, as
Vesta seems to have been Pelasgian: the latter exhibiting
the genius of domestic order, the former, its
fuller development in political society. But Vesta is,
though an Homeric idea, not an Homeric goddess.</p>

<p>Now while Homer fails, or more probably avoids,
to give us any direct information about the derivation
of the Greek races or deities, he notwithstanding establishes
by partial and incidental notices many traces of
exterior affinity, not always the less secure and trustworthy
because they are negative.</p>

<p>While going through the divinities in detail, I have
remarked upon such traits of their character, history,
or worship, as appeared to connect them with any particular
origin; but the question remains, can we find,
through however rude a resemblance, any general model
abroad for the Olympian system, or, in the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
such a model, any presumptive evidence from Homer,
which may serve to connect it with any national or
local root or roots in particular?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Olympian Gods and the Ethiopians.</i></div>

<p>It is well worthy of remark, that he has associated
the body of the Greek deities, as a body, with one,
and one only, point, exterior to the Greek nation.
That point is the country of the Ethiopians.</p>

<p>Homer has shown a peculiar interest in these Ethiopians.
They are <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμύμονες</span>: an epithet which he appears
to connect especially with purity of blood.
In the First Iliad, the whole body of the gods
are absent from Olympus for eleven days, to enjoy
the sacrifices offered by that people. In the Twenty-second
Iliad, the statement is less express as to time;
but again they are apparently enjoying themselves in
the same quarter, during the funeral rites of Patroclus,
and Iris is in haste to go thither, that she may not lose
her share. In the First Odyssey, Neptune is among
the same people for the same purpose, while the other
deities are in Olympus. In the Fifth Odyssey, he is
coming from among them, when he espies Ulysses on
his raft. The time intervening is so considerable, that
we must presume the two last-mentioned passages to
refer to two separate visits.</p>

<p>The following points may be considered as established:</p>

<p>1. The Ethiopians, visited as above, must be supposed
by Homer in the main to worship the same body of
deities as the Greeks.</p>

<p>2. The Ethiopians extend from the rising to the
setting sun; but those Ethiopians of whom Homer
speaks particularly, are in connection with sacrifices in
the East; for the Solyman mountains<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>, as conceived by
him, probably border upon Lycia, and they are on Nep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>tune’s
route<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>, from the Ethiopian country back to the
sea, which, as I hope to show elsewhere, runs along the
double line of the Mediterranean and the Euxine.</p>

<p>3. They are further fixed in a southern country by
their name, which indicates darkness or swarthiness of
countenance, and by the visit of Menelaus to them in
the course of his adventures, which lay exclusively to
the southward.</p>

<p>4. They are evidently distinguished by great liberality
or high favour in the sacrificial service of the gods.</p>

<p>5. They are defined to be by the Ocean, and thus in
the farthest situation to the South-east that was conceived
of by Homer and the Greeks.</p>

<p>6. At the same time, although they are the farthest
men in that direction<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>, they are nowhere described as
lying at a very great absolute distance. They are
simply <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τηλόθ’ ἐόντες</span>.</p>

<p>Now it is not only possible, but on every ground
likely, that in his conception of the South-eastern
Ethiopians, Homer mixed up together various traditions,
belonging to different places and nations. Even
as, in his conception of the Mouth of Ocean, which is
with him always one single mouth, he seems to have
blended and amalgamated geographical reports founded
upon more than one original, or prototype, in nature.</p>

<p>The Solyman name has suggested to some critics a
connection with the Salem of the Hebrews. But
the name is much more likely to be derived from
the Soliman Koh, a ridge of mountains running to the
south-west from Caubul, and sometimes defined as
extending into Persia. The liberality in sacrifice ill
accords with the early Persian religion, but finds a probable
original in that of the Medes with their order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
Magians. But upon the whole, it would seem that
Homer must have had a reason for the peculiar prominence
he has given to these South-eastern Ethiopians,
in connection with the gods of Olympus; for the association,
unless suggested by a reason, is neither natural,
nor in the manner of the Poet. Could it have been any
other than this, that he regarded their country, however
indeterminate its place in his imagination, as the original
seat of the religion of his own, and that he therefore
referred it thither bodily without notice of details?
Now this would mean as the original seat, also, of the
ancestors of the Hellenic tribes. We are not, in the
event of accepting such a supposition, to imagine that
he intended to make the assertion that the Olympian
system had been derived from Persia and Media as it
stood, but only to imply that there, according to
national tradition, lay its root. The Trojans, it will be
remembered, have their not Olympian but Idæan Jove:
and the Ethiopians are the only foreign race, with whom
he associates Olympus and its band of Immortals.</p>

<p>I have already stated elsewhere grounds for supposing
that the Achæans, as they were immediately an
Hellenic, were also primarily, as well as the other Hellenes,
a Persian race. We have seen the existence of
the Persian name in Greece, and its connection, according
to Homer, with what Homer thought the remotest
East, by the shore of Ocean. We have also seen its
connection with the Sun, the prime deity of the Persians.
This visible head of creation, standing next to
the Supreme Being, we find that the Greeks speedily
identify with their Apollo, who is so prominent as the
son of Jupiter, in dignity, in obedience, and in his
father’s favour, as to stand in a class entirely distinct
from that of his other sons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>On the one hand, we seem to find here matter confirmatory
of the Persian origin of the Hellenic tribes;
and on the other, a general indication of the derivation
of the earliest Greek religion from a certain part of
the East. But still we must beware of any over-broad
inference. The religion, it is likely, grew largely as it
travelled, and was developed freely after it had reached
its home in the Greek peninsula. And it would be
contrary to all reason to suppose that Homer was in a
condition to refer back to each of the Eastern races
their proper contribution towards the aggregate, though
we may justly suppose him able to draw some kind
of line between the system as it was flourishing in
Greece, with all its additions, elaborations and refinements,
and the crude undigested materials as they had
been imported from abroad; perhaps we might say,
between the system as he found it, and the same system
as he left it.</p>

<p>Considering, however, that Homer had a quasi-geographical
knowledge of Egypt, I do not suppose that
that country enters at all into his conception of the
Ethiopians. If so, then the representation of an unity
of religion with the Ethiopians, affords a presumption,
conformable undoubtedly to such other presumptions
as we have been able to gather from the poems, that
Homer did not regard Egypt as the principal source of
the religious system of Greece.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Herodotus on the Scythian religion.</i></div>

<p>I do not pretend to find, in any ancient system
handed down to us, even a skeleton of the Olympian
scheme; and I conclude it to be most probable, that
the Greeks had to form, or to reform, various members
of it, as well as merely to clothe and embellish
them. Yet it appears well worth while to refer to the
account of the Scythian religion given by Herodotus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
whose works form the great depository of knowledge
of this kind beyond the borders of Greece.</p>

<p>The ordinary Scythians, it will be remembered, seem
to be of the same race with the Medes, and to form
the stock from which the Pelasgians separated to turn
towards the south of Europe for settlements. They
lived in that pastoral state, anterior to tillage, which
Mommsen observes, through the forms of the Latin
language, to have marked the point before the severance<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>.
From the sign of feeding on milk, the Glactophagi
and Hippemolgi of Il. xiii. 5, 6, would appear to
belong to them, and the peaceful habits of the Pelasgians
are also represented in the character that Homer
gives, in the same passage, to their neighbours the
Abians.</p>

<p>The gods of the Scythians, according to Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>,
were:</p>


<ul><li>       1. Vesta.</li>
<li>       2. Jupiter.</li>
<li>       3. Earth, the supposed wife of Jupiter.</li>
<li>       4. Apollo.</li>
<li>       5. Celestial Venus.</li>
<li>       6. Hercules.</li>
<li>       7. Mars.</li></ul>



<p>Even in this very late picture, we find a strong resemblance
to what, from the Homeric text, would
appear to have been the primitive cluster of the Pelasgian
divinities. Earth is represented in Demeter, (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γῆ
μήτηρ</span>,) who appears in Il. xiv. 326 as one of the wives of
Jupiter. The Celestial Venus may include traditions of
Minerva, and of Artemis,&mdash;for the Scythians called her
Artimpasa,&mdash;along with those which came to be represented
in the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀφροδίτη</span>. All the deities, which
from Homer’s text have appeared to be especially Hellenic,
are also, it will be observed, absent from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
list: Juno, Neptune, Aidoneus, Persephone, Vulcan,
and Mercury.</p>

<p>But there were among these Scythians a tribe, called
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Βασιλήϊοι Σκύθαι</span>. It would seem plain from the
name, that these must have held among the Scythians
a position, in great measure analogous to that of the
Hellenic tribes among the mass of the Pelasgian
population. And certainly it is not a little curious,
that these kingly Scythians added to the list of
properly Pelasgian deities the worship of Thamimasidas,
a god of the sea, apparently equivalent to the
Hellenic Poseidon.</p>

<p>Again, let us take the account given by Herodotus
of the information he obtained in Egypt about the
Greek mythology. He states to us that, with certain
exceptions, the names of the Greek deities had been
known in Egypt from time immemorial. His exceptions
are, Neptune and Juno, the Dioscuri, Vesta,
Themis, the Graces and the Nereids. The statement
may at least be accepted as good to this extent, that
the deities here named were not drawn from Egypt.
They include, as will be seen, only one personification
of an idea which we have found cause to consider Pelasgian,
namely, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἱστίη</span> or <i>home</i>; with this Neptune and
Juno, who were Hellic deities; the Dioscouroi, representing
in an early stage the deification of national
heroes; the Graces, or the impersonations of ideas; and
the Nereids, or the personification of natural objects.
All of these persons and processes we have already referred
to the influence of the Hellic tribes.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, we appear to have in these accounts
a much clearer representation of the contribution made
by the Pelasgian part of the nation to the Olympian
system than we can find gathered elsewhere. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
Egyptian resemblances are chiefly isolated, though it
may have been from that quarter that Pelasgian Attica
learned the name and worship of the deity, which was
afterwards developed into the Homeric Pallas-Athene:
but among these Scythians we appear to find a group,
who exhibit to us in combination nearly all that we
have reason to believe specially Pelasgian, and, with
the obscure exception of Hercules, nothing besides.
While this group, as being Scythian, would have the
Arian country for its point of origin, it may still be
probable that other parts of the Olympian religion, besides
the worship of Neptune, such as the Juno and the
Persephone in particular, had come from the ‘Kingly’
Arians of the hills.</p>

<p>Thus far as to the relation between the Homeric
theo-mythology and any religious system or combination
to be found elsewhere. Let us now consider how
it stands with reference to each of the principal elements,
out of which the religions of the world were
habitually formed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Four several bases of religious systems.</i></div>

<p>There appear to be four leading forms in which,
either single or combined, religion has attracted, and
more or less commanded, the mind of man. It is
scarcely needful to add that one alone of these is genuine,
and that the three others are essentially depraved,
and finally self-destructive.</p>

<p>The first is the worship of the Divine Being: of
which the Holy Scriptures form, down to the period
with which they close, the principal record.</p>

<p>The second is the worship of man; founded, of
course, upon his deification. Of this the Greek mythology
affords the most conspicuous and weighty instance.</p>

<p>The third is the worship of external and inanimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
nature, which I mention next, not because of its place
in the order of ideas, but because of its great extension
and influence over races of vast numerical strength,
antiquity, and importance.</p>

<p>The fourth is the worship of the inferior creation, or
of animate nature in its lower ranks.</p>

<p>We have considered, in a former section, how far
the Greek mythology was indebted to the first of these
sources, the true and pure one.</p>

<p>The second, or anthropophuism, appears to have
formed its most proper and distinctive characteristic.
Further, it was the intellectual rather than the carnal
nature of man, which originally determined a law for
the construction of the Olympian system. The great
traditive deities were remodelled according to what
Scripture calls the ‘lust of the mind,’ long before the
‘lust of the flesh’ had touched them. We see, too,
that, of the deities of invention, those which were
purely Hellenic, such as Juno and Themis in particular,
represent either noble and commanding, or
else pure, ideas, connected with the development of
human life and society; while it is generally in deities
that have not undergone a full Hellenic remodelling,
that we see animal passion prevail; such as Mars,
Venus, Ceres, and Aurora.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nature-worship.</i></div>

<p>The third basis of religion is admirably described,
together with its apology, and its condemnation, in the
Book entitled the Wisdom of Solomon<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the
workmaster; but deemed either fire, or wind, or the swift air,
or the circle of the stars, or the violent water, or the lights of
heaven, to be the gods which govern the world. With whose
beauty if they being delighted took them to be gods; let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
know how much better the Lord of them is: for the first
author of beauty hath created them. But if they were
astonished at their power and virtue, let them understand by
them, how much mightier he is that made them. For, by the
greatness and beauty of the creatures, proportionably the
maker of them is seen. But yet for this they are the less to
be blamed; for they peradventure err, seeking God, and
desirous to find him. For, being conversant in his works,
they search him diligently, and believe their sight: because
the things are beautiful that are seen. Howbeit, neither are
they to be pardoned. For if they were able to know so much,
that they could aim at the world; how did they not sooner
find out the Lord thereof?’</p></div>

<p>And then the Wise Man proceeds to show, that far
inferior, again, to this, is the worship of mere images
as gods.</p>

<p>The worship of the elemental powers enters, I think,
only as a very secondary ingredient into the Homeric
or Olympian system: it is everywhere surmounted and
circumscribed by developments drawn from tradition or
from the principle of anthropophuism.</p>

<p>It is true that most of the great physical agents are
either personified by him, or else are in immediate
connection with some one of his deities: but there is
every appearance that the Greeks sometimes expelled,
sometimes reduced and depressed the principle of
Nature-worship, in their adaptation of foreign materials
to Hellenic uses.</p>

<p>1. Jupiter and Neptune, as we have seen, preside
over elements, but they are not elemental. Their relations
to air and sea are entirely different from those of
Vulcan to fire, and yet even he very greatly transcends
the dimensions of a merely elemental god. Their brotherhood
with Aidoneus, who is not elemental at all,
indicates, together with all other signs, that the air and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
sea are their respective territories, and are not the basis
of their divinity.</p>

<p>2. It seems quite impossible but that, if Nature-worship
had been the basis of the system, the Sun, as
the visible king of nature, must have had a prominent
and commanding position in the system; whereas his
place in Homer is even less than secondary. Looking
at the realm of nature, to search out a varied organism,
which would supply a powerful apparatus of instruments
operative upon man to a presiding intelligence, the
Greek naturally made <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς</span> the king of Air. But had he
merely wanted a symbol by which nature itself was to
speak, how could he have forborne to choose the Sun?</p>

<p>3. There is, indeed, an extended use in Homer of the
imagery of Nature-Powers. But however prominent as
poetry, this is altogether subordinate as religion. His
Nymphs and River-gods people the unseen, adorn his
verse, and even supply a kind of drapery to the scheme
of religious observances; but it is not by them that the
world is governed. And with them may very well be
classed, as far as the present argument is concerned, the
crowd of Homer’s metaphysical impersonations.</p>

<p>4. That Neptune in particular is not properly an
elemental power, seems to be made clear by three
things at the least:</p>

<p>a. He can act by land as well as sea; witness his
building the wall of Troy, and appearing as a warrior
on the battle-field.</p>

<p>b. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάλασσα</span>, with which he is connected, is decidedly
inferior, in its merely elemental character, to
Oceanus; yet Oceanus has no share in the government
of the world, and no moral personality, while Neptune
has equal dignity with Jupiter, and is not far behind
him in strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>c. The true elemental gods of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάλασσα</span>, it is
plain, according to Homer, are Nereus and Amphitrite;
of whom the first is locally confined to the depths of
the sea, and the other is scarcely a person, and cannot
ideally be disengaged from the curly-headed billows.</p>

<p>5. In the Olympian Court, which is the real centre,
according to Homer, of the government of the world,
there is scarcely to be found a pure example of a
Nature-power; there is no one leading deity, in whom
that idea is not wholly subordinate; and in many
of the leading deities, such as Minerva, Apollo, and
even Juno, it is hardly to be perceived at all.</p>

<p>6. As to Juno in particular. When we compare
the Greek with the Eastern religions, it appears that, if
the former had been conceived in the same spirit as
the latter, Juno ought to have been the earth, continually
impregnated by the heaven, and yielding those
fruits which would then stand as the proper results
of her maternity.</p>

<p>But instead of this, in the great lottery of the
universe, earth is actually left out, and remains undisposed
of. It never appears in Homer, except in
a formula of adjuration, in which we may naturally
enough look to find antique ideas; and this seems like
a stray vestige of another system, really founded on
Nature-worship. But there <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γαῖα</span> remains, so far as the
Greeks are concerned, isolated and undeveloped.</p>

<p>Meantime, for the vegetative life of Earth, wedded
to the Heavens, and bearing herbs and fruits, the
Greek mind substitutes the intelligent life of a Queen-divinity,
who with her husband becomes the nucleus
of the Olympian order, and marks the transition from
elemental religion to anthropophuism.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Secondary in the Olympian religion.</i></div>

<p>There is then a greatly qualified sense, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
assent may be given to the proposition, that the
Olympian dynasty of Homer sits enthroned upon the
ruins of a more ancient Nature-worship, and the sense
is this: that, before Hellenism had an historical existence,
there were systems founded on Nature-worship
in the east; that these systems were tributary to the
religion of Olympus, and that its framers made such
use of them as they found convenient.</p>

<p>But from Homer we are not authorized to believe
that such a system of Nature-worship ever preceded in
Greece the Olympian system. On the contrary, the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ῥέα</span>, the Oceanus and Tethys of Homer,
appear to be younger and not older than his chief
Olympian gods; that is, they appear to be metaphysical
creations, called into being to supply an ideal basis,
a <i>matrix</i> or mould, walled in with time and space, for
Jupiter and his wife and brothers to be cast in.</p>

<p>It is not before, but after the time of Homer, namely,
in Hesiod, that we see such development given to this
pseudo-archaic system as can alone allow it to be
taken for the image of something that had really
existed as a religion. For example, it would be quite
out of keeping with the tone of Homer were we to
find in him the sentiment which is contained in a
fragment of Euripides<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὁρᾶς τὸν ὑψοῦ τόνδ’ ἄπειρον αἰθέρα;</div>
       <div class="verse">τοῦτον νόμιζε Ζῆνα.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Brute-worship.</i></div>

<p>We have still to consider the relation of the Olympian
scheme to the last of the four <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στοιχεῖα</span>. The principle
of brute-worship was so marked a characteristic of the
Egyptian idolatry, that it seems to lie at the very foundation
of the system. Perhaps we should be justified
in associating with this principle the inability of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
Egyptians to attain to any high conceptions of beauty.
They scarcely could soar in this respect above the
standard of that which they regarded as a tabernacle
meet for divinity to dwell in.</p>

<p>The same principle appears to have found its way
into Persia probably at a late date, and from the Median,
not the Eteo-persian, source of the religious traditions
of the country. Malcolm<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> has given us the
copies, from remains found in the country, of the
Persian representations, probably however late ones, of
their divinities, exhibiting strange mixtures of human
form with that of the brute.</p>

<p>It would therefore be wonderful if we failed to find
in the Greek mythology some traces, however faint, of
an element that not only existed in Asia, but displayed
so much vigour there, as to have entered deeply into
the religion that even now sways a considerable portion
of its population, if not, indeed, to form the one
really capital and operative article of that religion.</p>

<p>Döllinger<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> has noted the points connected with the
state and being of animals, which might suggest ideas
capable of being developed into this repulsive system.
Such are the unity and tranquillity of animal life&mdash;it
being borne in mind that domesticated animals were
those which supplied the chief type of deity. Such,
again, is the instinct of the future, bearing a nearer
outward resemblance to foreknowledge than would
any anticipations founded on forethought, reasoning,
and experience. Above all, there seems to be force in
the remark that man, by his marked individuality, and
by the freedom of the will, is, as it were, disabled from
becoming the mere organ of another existence. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
gods in assuming human form, assumed in a great degree
human nature also. But the passive and neutral
nature of animals offered itself as a medium without
taste or colour, such as needed not in any manner to
alter or modify the powers of which it was to be the
vehicle.</p>

<p>Had the idea been in its origin that of an inherent
sacredness of animals as such, it is not probable that we
should have seen such extraordinary anomalies in its
development as those which permitted the same animal
to be adored in one province of Egypt, and immolated
in the next<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Its vestiges in the Olympian religion.</i></div>

<p>The grossness of brute-worship was completely refined
away by the Greeks during the process of transfer
to their own mythology. The vestiges of the system,
and they are no more than vestiges, still traceable in
the Homeric poems, are apparently as follows:</p>

<p>1. I find the chief note of it in the extraordinary
sacredness of the oxen of the Sun: a sacredness inconsistent
and inexplicable, if it be tried only by the circumjacent
incidents of the Odyssey, and by the laws of
the Greek mythology.</p>

<p>The offence of the crew of Ulysses consisted simply
in this; that<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>, after exhausting every effort to maintain
themselves, when they have at length no alternative
before them except that of starving, they consumed
some of the best among these oxen for food. They
observed, as far as they could, all the proper religious
rites, but they used leaves instead of barley, and water
for wine, inasmuch as neither of the usual requisites
were forthcoming. They promised a temple also to
the Sun, to be built on their return, and to be enriched
with abundant votive offerings. Lastly, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
any one who reads the manly and just speech of Eurylochus,
in which he proposes the sacrilege, will judge
that the sympathies of the Poet are with him. In this
speech, he states the necessity; he next proceeds to
vow the erection of a temple, and dedication of its ornaments
in the event of safe return. Then he concludes
by declaring, that if vengeance is, notwithstanding, to
be taken on them, he for his part would far rather die
once for all like a man than famish in the solitary
island. There is not in the tone of the speech the
slightest indication of impiety<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>.</p>

<p>The terrible punishment inflicted was prefigured by
extraordinary portents. The empty hides of the animals
crawled about<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>, and the flesh lowed on the very
spits. Here we see at its climax the fine Greek
imagination, working upon the foundation supplied by
the Egyptian superstition, and extracting from the
coarsest earthy matter the means of true poetical
sublimity.</p>

<p>It is impossible to conceive a case, in which the
offence committed is more exclusively of the kind
termed positive, or more entirely severed from moral
guilt, until we include the element to which the
poems do not expressly refer, of the elevated sanctity
attaching to the animal itself. The Homeric fiction
is<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>, that they were the playthings of the Sun in his
leisure hours. But to forbid the use of any of these
animals for food, even under the direst necessity,
would have been simply to caricature the nature of
positive commands, in the very same spirit as that
which would have had, not the sabbath made for man,
but man made for the sabbath. Still, when once we
let in the assumption that these animals had essen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>tially
sacred lives, which might not be taken away, then
the offence becomes a moral one of frightful profanation,
and the vengeance so rigorously exacted is intelligible.</p>

<p>I do not mean that Homer recognises that dogma
which the Egyptians then affirmed, and which at this
present epoch, after the lapse of three thousand years,
has wrought myriads of Hindoos to madness. The
religion of Greece included no such idea, and the
religious practice of the Greeks wholly precluded it.
But in this instance we see a part of the Egyptian religion
<i>in transitu</i>, in the very process of transmutation
that it was to undergo when passing into the Greek
mythology, which utterly repudiated its substance, but
strove to retain an image of it under poetic forms, betraying
by their inconsistency their exotic origin.</p>

<p>The consummation of the whole tale lies in this:
that the vengeance is not the mere personal act of the
Sun, but is inflicted by Jupiter himself on behalf of
the whole Olympian Court, to which the appeal had
been already made<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>.</p>

<p>2. Another instance, confirmatory of the statement
of Döllinger as to the <i>rationale</i> of brute-worship, is to
be found in the curious passage of the Iliad where
Xanthus, the horse of Achilles, is endowed with
speech. The gift is from Juno, but the limit of the
gift is carefully defined<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">αὐδήεντα δ’ ἔθηκε θεὰ λευκώλενος Ἥρη.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was utterance that Juno gave, not intelligence.
The matter to be spoken was not a gift. The horse
proceeds, evidently by a native insight into the future,
to intimate to Achilles his coming fate; at first more
darkly (v. 409); but when he comes nearer the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
and glances at a man as the ordained instrument of
doom (416),</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent26">ἀλλὰ σοὶ αὐτῷ</div>
       <div class="verse">μόρσιμόν ἐστι θεῷ τε καὶ ἀνέρι ἶφι δαμῆναι·</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>then, I suppose lest the animal should proceed to
particularize, and, though prophetic yet unwise, should
break the current of the hero’s thought and action at
the critical moment by naming Paris&mdash;the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐρινύες</span> are
made to interfere; they restore the order of nature, and
stay the exercise of Juno’s irregular and abnormal gift.</p>

<p>3. The immortality of these horses is probably conceived
in the same spirit. We may the more easily
understand it to be a poetical rendering of the Egyptian
belief in the divinity of many animals, when we recollect
that exemption from death is, with Homer, the
one and perhaps only essential characteristic of deity,
so that his gods are ordinarily defined by it as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀθάνατοι</span>.</p>

<p>4. We have another indication of relation to the
same ideas, in the assumption by deities of the forms
of various birds: namely, by Minerva, as Od. i. 320;
iii. 372; Il. vii. 59; Od. xxii. 240; by Apollo, Il. vii. 59;
by Sleep, Il. xiv. 290; and by Ino Leucothee, Od. v.
353. In this instance we again see the refining power
of the Greek imagination. It is only the forms of
birds which are assumed by Homeric deities: creatures
more ethereal, though not more intellectual, than the
other brute races; and whose figure, when assumed,
at once bestows in visible form an attribute of high
superiority to man, namely, the increased facility and
speed of locomotion.</p>

<p>5. One or two other traces may be suggested, but
they are slighter and more dubious. It is possible that
Homer drew from this source the Olympian horses of
Juno (Il. v. 720, 768&ndash;72) and the sea-horses of Nep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>tune
(Il. xiii. 23). A similar notion may be involved,
when the Poet makes Apollo stoop to feed the horses
of Admetus in Pieria, and the oxen of Laomedon on
Ida (Il. ii. 766, and xxi. 448). The serpent (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δρακὼν</span>)
appears in Homeric portents as a symbol, but without
peculiar meaning.</p>

<p>The horse was not one of the sacred animals of Egypt;
and when Homer placed it in such near relations with
deity, as he has done in these places and elsewhere, he
may not only have indulged a personal predilection, but
he also may have been converting the crudity of Egyptian
material to the form and uses of the Greek religion,
in the normal exercise of his vocation.</p>

<p>One concluding word may be said in extenuation of
the indignity which, according to our ideas, attaches
to the worship of the inferior animals. In the worship
of the elemental powers we see error, but in the worship
of beasts we see shame, and even brutality. Perhaps
this distinction may be due as much to pride as
to pious susceptibility.</p>

<p>Over animals, man has thoroughly obtained the
mastery; but Elemental powers are still in many cases
masters over us, and we lie like babes in the lap of
their strength and vastness. It does not appear clear
why we should consider the worship of that which is
more highly organized, and which comes half-way to
intelligence, as essentially more shameful than the
worship of inferior organizations without life or instinct
of any kind. If it be said that, by its negations, inanimate
Nature becomes a fitter shrine of deity than the
brutes, the same argument applied to the brutes, compared
with man, might equally avail to give claims to
brute-worship as compared with anthropophuism, against
which, notwithstanding, nature summarily revolts.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">SECT. VIII.<br />

<i>The Morals of the Homeric Age.</i></h2></div>

<p>We have now considered at some length the state
and tendencies of religion, both objective and subjective,
among the Greeks of the heroic age: let us proceed
to attempt a sketch of their morality; which
rested in part upon acknowledged relations to the
Olympian deities, but which, it is clear, had likewise
other supports and sanctions.</p>

<p>In general outline it may be thus summed up. An
high spirited, energetic, adventurous, and daring people,
they show themselves prone to acts of hasty violence,
and their splendid courage occasionally even degenerates,
under the influence of strong passion, into ferocity,
while their acuteness and sagacity sometimes, though
more rarely, take a decided tinge of cunning. Yet
they are neither selfish, cruel, nor implacable. At the
same time, self-command is scarcely less conspicuous
among them than strong, and deep, and quick emotion.
They are in the main a people of warm affections
and high honour, commonly tender, never morbid:
they respect the weak and the helpless; they
hold authority in reverence; domestic purity too is
cherished and esteemed among them more than elsewhere,
and they have not yet fallen into the depths of
sensual excess.</p>

<p>The Greek thanks the gods in his prosperity; witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
Laertes. In his adversity he appeals to them for aid;
or, if he is discontented, he complains of them; for he
harbours no concealed dissatisfaction. Ready enough
to take from those who have, he is at least as ready
to give to those who need. He represents to the life
the sentiment which another great master of manners
has given to his Duke of Argyle, in the ‘Heart of
Midlothian;’ ‘It is our Highland privilege to take
from all what <i>we</i> want, and to give to all what <i>they</i>
want<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>.’ Distinctions of class are recognised, but they
are mild and genial: there is no arrogance on the one
side, nor any servility on the other. Reverence is paid
to those in authority; and yet the Greek thinks in the
spirit, and moves in the sphere, of habitual freedom.
Over and above his warmth and tenacity in domestic
affections, he prizes highly those other special relations
between man and man, which mitigate and restrain
the law of force in societies as yet imperfectly organized.
He thoroughly admires the intelligence displayed
in stratagem; whether among the resources of
self-defence, or by way of jest upon a friend, or for the
hurt or ruin of an enemy; but life in a mask he cannot
away with, and holds it a prime article of his creed,
that the tongue should habitually represent the man<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The moral sense in the heroic age.</i></div>

<p>Before proceeding, however, to examine the morality
of the Greek heroic age, as to its particular sanctions,
or in any of its applications to the regulation of human
conduct, we are met by a preliminary question: had
the Greeks any idea of a fixed and substantive rule of
morals at all? were they believers in goodness as apart
from strength? did they recognise a law of right as
between man and man, or were their notions of relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
duty entirely founded on a more or less far-sighted
self-love, and on a prudential calculation of the consequences
which would follow to society, and to each
individual, if the rights of others were to be held in
universal or in general disregard?</p>

<p>When we consider how hard it is to keep the moral
standard high, even after religion has placed before
our view a Divine pattern for man to follow, and how
among the Greeks religion, first corrupted itself, had
already begun to pour out its own corruption upon
morals, we shall not venture to pitch our expectations
very high: optimism and pessimism are here alike out
of place: we want the clear, dispassionate, and direct
discernment of the facts. And when we observe how,
down to this day, the epithets which ought to designate
virtue only, and in particular the word <i>good</i>, tend irresistibly
to attach themselves to other gifts, such as
genius, rank, wealth, skill, and power, we must not
hastily conclude, from finding a similar use in Homer,
that there was no idea or standard of goodness except
that belonging to preeminence in the particular kind,
according to which a clever thief is a good thief; good,
that is, by doing effectually what he professes to do, or
good, like the unjust steward of the parable, in respect
of the intelligence he displays, though evil in respect
of the direction which he gives to it<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>.</p>

<p>Homer, in speaking of different classes of society,
uses the line<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">οἷά τε τοῖς ἀγαθοῖσι παραδρώωσι χέρηες.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But after all we can translate this, without much
verbal change, or any departure from our own idiom,
‘such services as the lower orders render to good
society,’ or ‘to the better classes.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Grote<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> says, that ‘the primitive import’ of the
words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς, ἐσθλὸς</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακὸς</span> relates ‘to power and
not to worth;’ and that the ethical meaning of them is
a later growth, which ‘hardly appears until the discussions
raised by Socrates, and prosecuted by his disciples.’
I ask permission to protest against whatever savours of
the idea that any Socrates whatever was the patentee
of that sentiment of right and wrong, which is the
most precious part of the patrimony of mankind.
The movement of Greek morality with the lapse of
time was chiefly downward, and not upward. It is
admitted, that what we may call the dynamical sense
of the epithets has held its ground in later times
along with their ethical signification: the important
question to be determined is, whether the latter signification
was an improvement introduced by civilization
into the code of barbarism, or whether it indicates a
principle of human nature on its better, which is also
its weaker side, and one which we see, all along the
course of history, struggling to assert itself against the
tyrannous invasion of other propensities and powers.</p>

<p>The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐσθλὸς</span> is found in combination with what
is absolutely vicious, in the remarkable case of Autolycus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">μητρὸς ἑῆς πατέρ’ ἐσθλὸν, ὃς ἀνθρώπους ἐκέκαστο</div>
       <div class="verse">κλεπτοσύνῃ θ’ ὅρκῳ τε<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the meaning of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐσθλὸς</span> appears to be, one who
excels; the application of it to Autolycus is not at all
unlike the commendation of the unjust steward; and
the epithet did not in the later Greek acquire any essentially
different force, or any exclusive appropriation
to moral excellence. Its use in Homer may be compared
with his application of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῖα</span> to Clytemnestra. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
it leans peculiarly to moral excellence. For the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμύμων</span>
is opposed to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπηνὴς</span>, who is certainly a moral
delinquent; and the highest honour of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμύμων</span> is,
that men proclaim him <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐσθλός</span> (Od. xix. 329&ndash;34).</p>

<p>Again, with respect to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χείρων</span> and its opposite <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρείσσων</span>,
with other words similar to both. In searching for the
signs of a standard in its own nature absolute, we can
expect little from a class of terms, which by their very
structure bear witness that they are simply comparative.
Especially the etymology of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χείρων</span>, directing us
to the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χεὶρ</span> as its root, exhibits force as its most
commanding and essential idea. Yet, when the aristocracy
of Ithaca are called (Od. xxi. 325) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πολὺ χείρονες
ἄνδρες</span>, must we not admit that even in this word there
inheres a strong moral element?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of the words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακός</span>.</i></div>

<p>But as to the words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακὸς</span>, the case is
far more clear: and here I ask, can it be shown that
Homer ever applies the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</span> to that which is
morally bad? or the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακὸς</span> to that which is morally
good? If it can, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cadit quæstio</i>; if it cannot, then we
have advanced a considerable way in proving the ethical
signification. For it is on all hands admitted, that besides
their proper sense, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακὸς</span>, like our <i>good</i>
and <i>bad</i>, have a derivative meaning, in which they are
employed to denote what is agreeable, or what is preeminent
in its kind, and the reverse respectively; qualities
which bear an analogy to goodness on the one
hand, and to badness on the other, according to the
universal testimony of human speech. Now, if the use
of this derivative sense stops short, in the case of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</span>,
when it comes to border on what is positively bad, and in
the case of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακὸς</span>, when it comes to touch upon what is
positively good, there must be a reason for the abrupt
cessation, at that point, of the function of the words;
and it can be none other than that nature herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
revolts from a contradiction in terms; as we never say
a good villain, or a bad saint. But the contradiction
would not exist, unless the ethical sense were inherent
in the words.</p>

<p>Now, I venture to state, with as much confidence as
can well exist in the case of a negative embracing such
a number of instances, that we do find this limitation
throughout the poems of Homer, in the secondary use
both of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</span> and of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακός</span>. In one passage there is
at first sight some obscurity in the meaning of the
latter term, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακὸς δ’ αἰδοῖος ἀλήτης</span><a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>. Here however the
context plainly shows it to be, ‘it will not do for a
mendicant to be shy.’</p>

<p>But the positive sense of both words can be clearly
and indisputably made out from a number of passages,
of which I will quote a portion.</p>

<p>Although it is true, that in Homer the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</span>
very often refers more to the ideas of particular excellences
and of power, than to that of moral worth; yet
in some passages we find a latent bias, as it were, towards
the last named idea, and in others we have a clear and
full expression of it.</p>

<p>As an example of the first, I quote the description
of Agamemnon<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφότερον, βασιλεύς τ’ ἀγαθὸς κρατερός
τ’ αἰχμητής</span>, ‘A good king, and a brave warrior.’ Now
the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</span> here evidently has a special regard
to the moral element. Homer surely intends to describe,
by the epithets he applies to each of the two
substantives, a special excellence suitable to each character
respectively. The goodness, so to speak, of a
warrior consisted in bravery: the goodness of a king,
partly indeed in prudence, but chiefly in justice, in mildness,
and in liberality. If <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</span> in this place meant
merely ‘good in the virtue of its kind,’ then it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
as well stand with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰχμητής</span> as with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλεὺς</span>, and therefore
the antithesis would be a bad and pointless one.</p>

<p>In other cases the moral colouring of the term is full
and indubitable. Bellerophon<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>, when he resists the seduction
of the wife of Prœtus, is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὰ φρονέων</span>. Jupiter,
when incensed, is described by Minerva thus, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φρεσὶ μαίνεται
οὐκ ἀγαθῇσιν</span><a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>. To follow good advice is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ δὲ πείσεται
εἰς ἀγαθόν περ</span><a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>. A man who is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς καὶ ἐχέφρων</span>, is
also the one who must necessarily have regard and affection
for his wife<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>. And Clytemnestra, before she
was corrupted, had good dispositions; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φρεσὶ γὰρ κέχρητ’
ἀγαθῇσιν</span><a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>.</p>

<p>The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακὸς</span> again, in a majority of cases, refers to
defect or calamity in things, or to poltroonery, or other
baseness of that kind, in persons: but it directly indicates
moral badness in such passages as the following.
Leiodes pleads that he tried to keep the Suitors from
doing wrong, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακῶν ἄπο χεῖρας ἔχεσθαι</span><a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a>. Telemachus
warns the Suitors that the gods will turn upon them in
wrath, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγασσάμενοι κακὰ ἔργα</span><a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>. Jupiter views such
deeds with indignation, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεμεσσᾷται κακὰ ἔργα</span><a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>. And
Juno reproaches Apollo for giving countenance to the
Trojans, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακῶν ἕταρ’ αἰὲν ἄπιστε</span>, where our finding
faithlessness in the immediate context, points to moral
depravity as the signification of the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακῶν</span><a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαιος</span>.</i></div>

<p>In the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαιος</span>, however, we have an instance of
an epithet never employed except in order to signify a
moral or a religious idea. Like the word <i>righteous</i>
among ourselves, it is derived from a source which
would make it immediately designate duty as between
man and man, and also as it arises out of civil relations.
But it is applied in Homer to both the great branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
of duty. And surely there cannot be a stronger proof
of the existence of definite moral ideas among a people,
than the very fact that they employ a word founded on
the observance of relative rights to describe also the
religious character. It is when religion and morality
are torn asunder, that the existence of moral ideas is
endangered.</p>

<p>Minerva, in the form of Mentor, is pleased with
Telemachus for handing the cup first to her at the
festival in Pylos, because it is a tribute of reverence to
superior age. For this he is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεπνυμένος ἀνὴρ</span><a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαιος</span>, and the idea is that of relative duty. Again,
when she advises him for a while to let the Suitors
alone, it is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπεὶ οὔτι νοήμονες οὐδὲ δίκαιοι</span><a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>; and they
do not know the retribution that hangs over them.
In this case the meaning must be either ‘just’ or ‘pious.’</p>

<p>In another case, where the very same phrase is
employed, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαιος</span> can only mean ‘pious.’ ‘Jupiter,’ says
Nestor, ‘ordained calamities for the Greeks on their
return, because they were not all either intelligent or
righteous<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent10">ἐπεὶ οὔτι νοήμονες οὐδὲ δίκαιοι</div>
       <div class="verse">πάντες ἔσαν.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘Wherefore many of them perished’ (he continues)
‘through the wrath of Minerva, who set the two
Atridæ at variance.’ Now here it appears that the
original offence of the Greeks could only have consisted
in the omission of the usual sacrifices, while the passage
has no reference whatever to relative duties: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαιος</span>
therefore must refer simply to duty towards the gods.
And, however imperfect may be that notion of divine
duty which made it consist in sacrifice wholly or
mainly, yet plainly the neglect to sacrifice was for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
the Greeks of the heroic age a moral offence, although
it consisted only in the breach of a law of the class
termed positive. A passage yet more fatally adverse
to the position of Mr. Grote is, I think, that where
Homer describes the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄβιοι</span><a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δικαιότατοι ἀνθρώπων</span>.
For there he appears to be speaking of persons clearly
less advanced in civilization, more rude, less wealthy
and intelligent, than the Greeks; and yet he applies to
them an epithet which proclaims them to have been,
in his opinion, either the most just, or the most pious
of mankind.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Religion and morals not dissociated.</i></div>

<p>Moreover, it does not appear that anywhere among
the Greeks were religion and morals as yet effectually
dissociated. It is true that the language of mere mythology
treats the religious character of man as established
by bounty in sacrifice. But this is one of the points, and
a very vital one, in which the theistic system of the
Greeks was worse than their ethical instinct, and became,
therefore, a positive source of corruption. While
the Scriptures of the Old Testament rigidly controlled
the propensity of man to substitute perfunctory observances
for the service of the heart, by saying, ‘to obey
is better than sacrifice,’ the Jupiter of the Greeks tells
them, that to sacrifice is better than to obey. And it is
only in the mouth of a traditive deity that we find any
more elevated sentiment. To a certain extent, indeed,
yet not effectually, this representation may be qualified,
if we recollect that in these passages the deities of
Olympus, conceived according to the laws of anthropophuism,
when they have occasion to speak of human
piety, speak of it in that aspect under which it was
peculiarly beneficial to themselves, but do not on that
account intend wholly to set aside its other parts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
while they undoubtedly disturb the scale of relative
importance in the moral order.</p>

<p>But man, the handiwork of God, was less depraved
than the idols which were the handiwork of man.
Among the Greeks, the pious man is nowhere separated
from the just or moral man. Not in words, for the
question of a stranger always is, whether men are, on
the one hand, insolent, fierce, <i>and</i> unrighteous, or, on
the other, hospitable <i>and</i> pious to the gods<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἦ ῥ’ οἵγ’ ὑβρισταί τε καὶ ἄγριοι οὐδὲ δίκαιοι,</div>
       <div class="verse">ἠὲ φιλόξεινοι, καί σφιν νόος ἐστὶ θεουδής;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nor are they in any instance separated in deeds. We
hear of no religious observances by the Suitors in
Ithaca; but Nestor and Menelaus are both found engaged
in them. The wicked Ægisthus, having corrupted
Clytemnestra and gained the throne, then offered
many sacrifices to the gods in the hope of keeping
it, and suspended many decorations in their honour<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>;
but he is not on this account spoken of with less
horror, nor indeed did this extorted profession save him
from divine vengeance, sent by the hand of Orestes.
Nor does it appear that he had ever been liberal in
sacrifice before. The persons who are extolled, obviously
or expressly, on this ground in the Odyssey are,
the illustrious Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>, and the trusty Eumæus in his
humble cottage<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>. So that on the whole, as between
Greek and Greek, regularity in divine worship by
sacrifice was neither taken for the substance of morality,
nor allowed as a substitute for it, but was a test of
it, and was habitually found in union with it. The
connection is clearly set out in the case of Eumæus<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Moral elements in Sacrifice.</i></div>

<p>Nor must we forget that, had it been otherwise,
a constant moral profanation, abhorred by the feeling
of the time, would have been involved. For sacrifice,
as ought to be the case with all ritual, had a moral
character and adjuncts. It was either ordinary, as
at the common meal, or solemn. In the former case
the surrender by man of a portion of his food was
a witness to God as the giver, and an expression of
thankfulness intelligible to an unsophisticated age.
In the latter case, and even in the former<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>, prayer or
thanksgiving were commonly combined with the rite.
The spirit of man, when he approached the altar,
was bowed down before the powers of heaven; and
though it was a heavy sin in nations who had a clear
knowledge of God to lapse into the practices of those
who could but feebly grope (to use the language of
saint Paul<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>) for Him, yet the use of religious observances,
when it is ordinarily combined, as we find it
combined in Greece, with the possession in other
respects of virtuous character, is in effect one of the
strongest testimonies to the existence of a substantive
standard of morals, which it associates at once with
the unseen world, and not with any mere reckoning of
results, drawn from the life and experience of man.</p>

<p>If then the Greeks of the heroic age recognised a
real type of good and evil in human action, the next
question is, what were the motive powers by which
they were drawn towards the practice of virtue?</p>

<p>These powers proceeded from three sources.</p>

<p>One was a regard to the gods; to their rewarding
the good, and punishing the bad. Of this we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
already treated in regard to some of the most important
points. The general proof rests upon almost
every page of the poems, especially as regards the
punishment of the unkind, unjust, and cruel. The
Homeric representations of a future state obscurely,
but sensibly, add strength to the same class of
sanctions.</p>

<p>The second was the voice of conscience, speaking
for each man within his own breast<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>.</p>

<p>The third was a sentiment ranging between reverence
and fear, which led to the performance of duty, and to
the avoidance of crime, in consideration of the general
authority and established opinion of mankind.</p>

<p>We may consider those examples from bygone days,
which are so often adduced either for warning or for
imitation, as belonging to this third division of moral
powers.</p>

<p>The finer forms of this third class of sentiments pass
by imperceptible shades into the second.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The principle of conscience.</i></div>

<p>After his conquest of Hypoplacian Thebes, Achilles
would not despoil the body of the slain Eetion, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σεβάσσατο
γὰρ τόγε θυμῷ</span>: accordingly he burnt him, with
his precious armour on. Now it would have been no
crime to strip him of this valuable booty, and therefore
would have drawn down no vengeance: but the high
standard of his own chivalrous feelings would not suffer
the act. We have no reason to suppose that in this
instance he had any regard to the general opinion of the
Greeks. For as when they gathered round the corpse
of Hector, every one of them inflicted a wound upon
it, and as it was the common custom of the war to
strip the dead of their arms, nothing can be more
unlikely than that the army would have resented a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
similar proceeding on the part of Achilles towards
Eetion. It was therefore to his own mind that he
deferred. Here there was a conscience not only taking
notice of the broader and, so to speak, coarser, outlines
of duty, but likewise exhibiting a refined and tender
sense of it.</p>

<p>Again, Telemachus says, by way of appeal to the
good feeling of the Suitors themselves (Od. ii. 138.),</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὑμέτερος δ’ εἰ μὲν θυμὸς νεμεσίζεται αὐτῶν,</div>
       <div class="verse">ἔξιτέ μοι μεγάρων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In this place he seems to refer to the sense of right
within each man, and by no means to their regard for
appearances as before each other; while that, from
which he exhorts them to abstain, is a purely moral
wrong. So Glaucus appears to aim at the individual
conscience, when he impresses on Hector and the Trojans
the duty of recovering the body of Sarpedon, lest the
Myrmidons should deface his remains (Il. xvi. 544&ndash;6).
Again, Menelaus addresses a similar exhortation to the
Greeks, and here expressly exhorts each person to feel
and act for himself (Il. xvii. 254),</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἀλλά τις αὐτὸς ἴτω, νεμεσιζέσθω δ’ ἐνὶ θυμῷ</div>
       <div class="verse">Πάτροκλον Τρωῇσι κυσὶν μέλπηθρα γενέσθαι.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In one passage particularly, Telemachus distinguishes
with great clearness the three kinds of motive by the
terms proper to them respectively (Od. ii. 64&ndash;7);</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent26">(1) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεμεσσήθητε καὶ αὐτοὶ</span>,</div>
       <div class="verse">(2) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλλους τ’ αἰδεσθῆτε περικτίονας ἀνθρώπους</span>,</div>
       <div class="verse"><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἳ περιναιετάουσι·</span> (3) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεῶν δ’ ὑποδείσατε μῆνιν</span>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νέμεσις</span>, for the self-judging conscience: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span>,
for human opinion: and lastly, fear, in regard to the
divine wrath.</p>

<p>The existence of the moral standard within a man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
also, I think, very strongly implied in the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτασθαλίη</span>,
which is applied to deep, deliberate, habitual, or
audacious wickedness. For when it is intended to let in
any allowance for mere weakness, or for solicitation from
without, or for a foolish blindness, then the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη</span> is
used. And I doubt whether, in any one instance
throughout the poems, these two designations are ever
applied to one and the same misconduct. It is certainly
contrary to the general and almost universal
rule. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτασθαλίη</span> is something done with clear
sight and knowledge, with the full and conscious action
of the will: it is something regarded as wholly without
excuse, as tending to an entire moral deadness, and as
entailing final punishment alike without notice and
without mercy. Nothing can account for the introduction
into a moral code of a form of offence conceived
with such intensity, and ranked so high, except
the belief that the man committing it had deliberately
set aside that inward witness to truth and righteousness,
supplied by the law of our nature, in the repudiation
of which the universal and consentient voice of
mankind has always placed the most awful responsibility,
the extremest degree of guilt that the human
being can incur.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Regard for general opinion.</i></div>

<p>The high place assigned throughout the poems to
public opinion as a moral check is visible at every turn.
And this check applies variously to various classes. With
the most abandoned, like the Suitors, it is feeble; and
is only invoked on special occasions, as when Telemachus
combines it, in the passage lately cited, with
the other moral sanctions. Even Paris is represented
as quite beyond the reach of it: and Helen meekly
wishes, that if the gods had determined she should
live, she could have been the husband of a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
more open to the influence of the public sentiment<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὃς ῥ’ ᾔδη νέμεσίν τε καὶ αἴσχεα πόλλ’ ἀνθρώπων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But upon characters less frivolous and less corrupt,
this power acts with great efficacy: so much so, that
Phœnix says he was restrained, when in his passion,
from killing his father by some benevolent deity,
whose mode of proceeding was, we shall perceive, very
remarkable: for the suggestion he made to Phœnix
with such good effect was, not that he would be punished
by the gods for the offence, but that he would
become an offence and scandal among men<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἀλλά τις ἀθανάτων παῦσεν χόλον, ὅς ῥ’ ἐνὶ θυμῷ</div>
       <div class="verse">δήμου θῆκε φάτιν, καὶ ὀνείδεα πόλλ’ ἀνθρώπων,</div>
       <div class="verse">ὡς μὴ πατροφόνος μετ’ Ἀχαιοῖσιν καλεοίμην.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δήμου φάτις</span>, or public opinion, weighs even with
the matron Penelope among the motives to her virtuous
and heroic conduct; and the maid Nausicaa, no
less circumspect than artless, finds in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φῆμις ἀδευκὴς</span>,
the bitter gossip, of Scheria, an apology for desiring
Ulysses not to enter the city in her company<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>.</p>

<p>But the sentiment of regard to general opinion
comes out in other and yet finer forms as a practical
regulator of conduct in the heroic age.</p>

<p>Perhaps we might venture to rely upon the uses of
the single word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span>, with the cognate verb and adjective,
in Homer, for proof that the condition of the
Greeks of his age was a condition of high civilization,
in that which constitutes its most essential part,
namely, that which relates to the affections and passions
of man; the expansion by moral forces of the
one, and the compression of the other.</p>

<p>Shame, in all its many forms, has more than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
pervading characteristic to mark it as an agent alike
powerful and delicate in its influence upon human
conduct.</p>

<p>First, it essentially involves this idea: that while it
refers to an external standard, independent of ourselves
though able to act upon us, still the power thus
invoked is one altogether distinct from the idea of force.
So sensitive indeed is the feeling of shame, that at the
first moment when force comes into view, it alters its
nature, and passes into fear. That which it apprehends
is something, which dwells only in the ethereal region
of opinion; and yet this, by the fineness of its appreciation,
it converts into an agent effective both to excite
and to restrain. Thus it exhibits to us the human
spirit guided by silken reins, and in this way bears
emphatic witness to the high training, by which alone
it can become susceptible of so gentle a guidance.</p>

<p>Secondly, it embraces not only the character of acts
as they are in themselves or appear to us, but also the
aspect which they will naturally present to others. It
therefore essentially involves the recognition of a high
form of relative duty: it obliges us, in regulating the
whole tenour of our conduct, to make the feelings of
others an element in our own decisions. This principle
of a mutual regard, not confined to certain positive
acts of relative duty, but pervading the whole course
of moral action, lies at the root of all genuine and high
civilization.</p>

<p>Shame must have reference to some standard exterior
to ourselves, and it therefore tends towards uprooting
the law of selfishness. In one of its highest forms,
the one perhaps most familiar to us in Homer, it is
termed self-respect. But self-respect does not mean
a regard to self: it means a virtuous regard to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
standard established by adequate consent and authority,
and owned, not set up, by the individual conscience;
together with a determination that ‘self’ shall
be made to conform to it.</p>

<p>The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φθορὰ</span> of this sentiment is what we term false
shame: which does evil, or refrains from good, in submission
to a depraved standard of opinion external to
us, and in defiance of our own knowledge of right.
This kind of shame is treated with no respect in Homer:
for examples of it we must look to Amphimachus
and Leiodes, two better-minded but complying Suitors,
who end by perishing with the rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The force and forms of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδώς</span>.</i></div>

<p>The numerous forms of the sentiment of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> in
the heroic age are a proof of the large and varied development
to which it had already attained.</p>

<p>How fine a feeling is that according to which, as with
Homer, the bold men are also the shamefaced ones!
as in his line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">αἰδομένων δ’ ἀνδρῶν πλέονες σόοι ἠὲ πέφανται.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This line, as it is repeated, seems to have the character
of a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γνώμη</span> in the poems<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>.</p>


<p>The most marked and frequent use of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> is in the
sense of self-respect as applied to military honour and
bravery. The words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς, Ἀργεῖοι</span>, which are employed
as an exhortation to fight, constitute one of the Homeric
formulæ. Homer does not permit this use of the word
to the Trojans: but once it is employed for his gallant
favourites, the Lycians. (Il. xvi. 422. xvii. 336.)</p>

<p>Once, indeed, the term is applied to Trojans, but this
is in the converse of the usual sense. It would be <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span>,
a disgrace, says Æneas, were we to let Troy be taken
through our want of manhood. This is a lower signification.
And again, as we shall see, the established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
formula of military incitement for the Trojans is different
and less refined<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> is an excess of deference, or what
we might call scrupulosity; the feeling which carries the
fastidious observance of some right sentiment towards
others up to the point where it threatens to interfere
with a public or other clear duty. So Telemachus begs
of Nestor, ‘tell me the truth,’</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">μηδέ τί μ’ αἰδόμενος μειλίσσεο, μηδ’ ἐλεαίρων<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the Doloneia, Agamemnon, fearful that Diomed will
choose Menelaus as a companion out of deference, says,
‘Do not let <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> influence you: choose the best man.’
Sometimes it is compassion, or ruth; as when Achilles,
before the ransom, is said to show no <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> towards
the body of Hector. But here <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> includes the idea of
shame and self-respect. Sometimes it is reverence towards
a superior, as in Od. xiv. 505, and in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδοῖος</span> applied
by Helen to Priam in Il. iii. 172. In this manner it
becomes applicable to the sentiments a man should entertain
towards the gods,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἀλλ’ αἰδεῖο θεοὺς, Ἀχιλεῦ<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And this is a very remarkable use of the term, because
Priam certainly does not mean to urge upon Achilles
a dread of the gods, but something quite distinct.
Sometimes it is applied by a superior to an inferior;
and means ‘his or her dues,’ as among the Immortals,
where Jupiter says to Thetis, that he reserves the
honour of the ransom for Achilles,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">αἰδῶ καὶ φιλότητα τεὴν μετόπισθε φυλάσσων<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It may also be felt towards an inferior among men:
Agamemnon is exhorted to feel it towards Chryses<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>,
for it is not a personal sentiment, but implies an object,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
outside the mere person who is the immediate occasion
of it. So Achilles is intreated to revere (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἴδεσθαι</span>) Lycaon,
a vanquished and suppliant enemy<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes it signifies the constitution of a special
relation, over and above the general bond between man
and man. A person’s <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδοῖοι</span> are his relations, friends,
guests, and the like. Even so a wanderer is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδοῖος</span> to
the gods (Od. v. 447). Sometimes it means purely
mental modesty, as in Od. viii. 171, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ δ’ ἀσφαλέως ἀγορεύει
αἰδοῖ μειλιχίῃ</span>; he speaks with that engaging bashfulness
and careful indication of respect for his audience,
which forms a principal grace of the orator. Sometimes
the physical, as well as mental, quality of modesty; as
when <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> kept the goddesses at home (Od. viii. 324).
Sometimes, again, simply shyness; as when Telemachus
is exhorted by Minerva to put away <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> in Od. iii. 14;
or as in the phrase <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακὸς δ’ αἰδοῖος ἀλήτης</span>; ‘it will never
do for a beggar to be shy.’</p>

<p>No finer shading of sentiment, I think, can be found
in the language of the most civilized nations, nor any
case so remarkable of a high and tender, and at the
same time largely developed state of feeling at a time
when material progress was so partial, rude, and slight.
And of the vital importance of this element of the
Greek moral code, we find a proof in the representation
of Hesiod, who gives it as a characteristic of his
iron, or post-Homeric, age, that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> along with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νέμεσις</span>
had fled from the earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Other cognate terms.</i></div>

<p>There are other words, the use of which in Homer
approximates occasionally to the sense of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδώς</span>. The
nearest of them is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σέβας</span> (as in Il. xviii. 178), with its verb
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σέβομαι</span>; which, as we have seen, is sometimes applied
simply to an internal standard recognised by the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>science.
But in Il. iv. 242, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὔ νυ σέβεσθε;</span> seems to be
equivalent to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐκ αἰδεῖσθε;</span> or ‘for shame.’</p>

<p>The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νέμεσις</span>, too, is sometimes used in a sense
akin to that of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδώς</span>: as when Neptune exhorts the
Greeks, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐν φρεσὶ θέσθε ἕκαστος αἰδῶ καὶ νέμεσιν</span> (Il. xiii.
121): compare vi. 351. Again, in Od. i. 263, ii. 136,
xxii. 40. But this sentiment is usually half way between
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδὼς</span> and fear, because what it apprehends, though it is
not force, yet neither is it simple disapproval; rather it
is disapproval with heat, disapproval into which passion
enters. It contributes, however, to complete a very
remarkable picture of the human mind.</p>

<p>The comparison between Greeks and Trojans, or
Europeans and Asiatics, will prove, we shall find,
greatly in favour of the former as to most parts of
their morality. We have now to touch upon a feature
in Greek manners which is unfavourable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Homicide in the heroic age.</i></div>

<p>With regard to the practice of homicide, the ordinary
Greek morality was extremely loose; while we
have no evidence of a similar readiness for bloodshedding
among the Trojans: and enough is told us of
Trojan life and manners to have probably brought out
this characteristic, had it existed.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks, to have killed a man was considered
in the light of a misfortune, or at most a prudential
error, an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτη πυκινὴ</span><a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>, when the perpetrator of
the act had come among strangers as a fugitive for protection
and hospitality. On the spot, therefore, where
the crime occurred, it could stand only as in the nature
of a private and civil wrong, and the fine payable was
regarded, not (which it might have been) as a mode,
however defective, of marking any guilt in the culprit,
but as, on the whole, an equitable satisfaction to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
wounded feelings of the relatives and friends, or as an
actual compensation for the lost services of the dead
man. The religion of the age takes no notice of the
act whatever<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>.</p>

<p>The ordinary practice, we learn from the blunt
speech of Ajax to Achilles<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>, was to accept the established
fine upon the loss even of a brother or a son, if
offered, and then to let the slayer remain unharmed. If
he would not pay, or if the relations would not accept
the payment, the alternative was flight: but it does not
appear that this entailed any loss of character, perhaps
rather otherwise. It was, however, the most common
issue of such an affair, and, as such, it furnishes Homer
with a simile. Priam, appearing before Achilles by
surprise, is compared to a man who, having had the
misfortune to kill somebody, appears unexpectedly in
a strange place<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Eight instances in the poems.</i></div>

<p>We will proceed to examine the cases of homicide
recorded in the poems, which are alike numerous and
remarkable.</p>

<p>I. Medon<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>, the illegitimate brother of Oilean Ajax,
migrates from Locris to Phylace, having, in the usual
phrase, killed a man, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄνδρα κατακτάς</span>. This man was a
kinsman, not improbably a brother, (for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γνωτὸς</span> may mean
brother, as in Il. iii. 174, and xxii. 234), of his ‘stepmother,’
as she is called; that is, of Eriopis, the lawful wife
of his father. And yet he retains or improves his position
in Phylace, and appears, in the Thirteenth Iliad, as the
commander of all the Phthians except the Myrmidons.</p>

<p>II. Theoclymenus<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>, of the prophetic family of Melampus,
suddenly makes his appearance before Tele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>machus,
when he is about to embark from the Peloponnesus
for Ithaca. He inquires of Telemachus who
he is<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>; and, on finding that the youth is not in his
own country, but a stranger, he says, ‘So am I: I have
killed a man, and am flying from the vengeance of his
family: they are powerful, and I am in fear lest they
should take my life.’ Telemachus immediately promises
to take him on board, and entertain him hospitably.
He does not seem at all shocked at the intimation
he has received. He does not think it worth
while to ask the fugitive, whether he killed the man
wantonly, or under provocation. But he forthwith
assigns to him the place of honour<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent20">πὰρ δὲ οἷ αὐτῷ</div>
       <div class="verse">εἷσε Θεοκλύμενον.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>III. The next is an instance not less remarkable than
the one last named. Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules
and Astyoche, kills Licymnius the maternal uncle of his
father, and his own grand-uncle. The sufferer is, moreover,
in his old age, or he could hardly be the grand-uncle
of an adult person; and no plea or palliation is mentioned
for the act. The children and grandchildren of
Hercules prepare to levy war upon him: but so far is
he from having suffered in character for what hardly
can have been other than a barbarous and brutal action,
that he is enabled to raise a large body of emigrants,
who accompany him to Rhodes. When distributed
there in three settlements, they are blessed by the
peculiar favour of Jupiter; and Tlepolemus appears
before Troy as the commander of the Rhodian contingent<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>.</p>

<p>IV. Again, the friendship of Achilles and Patroclus
had its origin in the circumstance that Menœtius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
delivered over his son into the protection of Peleus,
because, being a youth, he had quarrelled with another
youth, the son of Amphidamas, over a game of dice, and
had slain him, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νήπιος, οὐκ ἐθέλων</span>, as the Poet says; that
is, of course, without malice prepense<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>. This is the
more worthy of notice, because it is evident that the
character of Patroclus, partly perhaps for the sake of
contrast with that of Achilles, and therefore of relief
to it, is meant to be represented as one of peculiar
gentleness<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>; a quality in which no one of the great
Greek chieftains, except Menelaus, can compete with
him.</p>

<p>V. In the Fifteenth Iliad, Hector slays Lycophron,
son of Mastor, when he is aiming at Ajax. This was
an inhabitant of Cythera who had quitted his country
for homicide, ‘but whom,’ says Ajax to Teucer, ‘we
honoured as if he had been a beloved parent<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>.’</p>

<p>VI. Again, the case of Epeigeus is remarkable; for
he had been lord of Budeum:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὅς ῥ’ ἐν Βουδείῳ εὐναιομένῳ ἤνασσεν</div>
       <div class="verse">τὸ πρίν·</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But having slain a cousin, apparently also of the higher
order, he had to fly to Peleus and Thetis for protection<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>.</p>

<p>VII. In the Thirteenth Odyssey, Ulysses, after being
deposited in Ithaca, gives a fabulous account of himself
to the disguised Minerva, in which we may be sure
that he includes nothing which was deemed essentially
dishonourable. In this account he represents himself
as a fugitive from Crete on account of homicide.
Orsilochus, the son of Idomeneus, had endeavoured,
as he says, to deprive him of his share of the Trojan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
booty: for this cause he waylaid him by night, took
away his life without being perceived by any one as
he was returning from the country, and then embarked,
to avoid the consequences, in a Phœnician ship<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>.</p>

<p>VIII. An anonymous Ætolian, having slain a man,
fled to Ithaca, visited Eumæus, and as a matter of
course was entertained, nay petted, by him; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ δέ μιν
ἀμφαγάπαζον</span> (Od. xiv. 379&ndash;81).</p>

<p>Even this great number of instances do not so fully
illustrate the familiarity of the practice, and its thorough
disconnection from the idea of moral turpitude, as the
mode in which it furnishes the material of general
illustration or remark. When Homer desires to represent
on the shield of Achilles the ordinary form of
public business in an assembly, he chooses a trial for
homicide<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>. And so Ulysses, when explaining to Telemachus
the formidable difficulties with which, after
the slaughter of the Suitors, he has to contend, observes
that those whom he has slain were the very
flower of the community; whereas, in ordinary cases,
a man flies his country after having put but a single
person to death, and this even though he be one who
has few to take up his quarrel<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>.</p>

<p>Now if we knew these facts concerning the Greeks
of the heroic age, and knew nothing else, we should
at once conclude that they were an inhuman and
savage people, who did not appreciate the value of
human life. But this is not so. They are not a cruel
people. There is no wanton infliction of pain throughout
the whole operations of the Iliad, no delight in the
sufferings of others. The only needless wounds are
wounds given to the dead<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>; a mode of action which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
imputed nothing brutal or degrading, in times when
mankind had not yet learned from the Christian Revelation
the honour due to the human body.</p>

<p>It is not then mere savageness, and the low estimate
put upon life, which determines the view of the heroic
age with respect to homicide. And if not, then it
can only be an unbalanced appreciation of some other
quality, such as courage, which was commonly implied
and exhibited in such cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Why viewed with little disfavour.</i></div>

<p>It seems as though the display of force and spirit of
daring, which accompany crimes of violence in a rude
age, had such a value in the estimation of the early
Greeks, as to excuse proceedings which would otherwise
have been visited with the severest censure. We
shall find reason to believe that Paris may have had a
certain credit in their eyes for carrying off Helen by
the strong hand, which went to redeem or mitigate his
adultery, and breach of hospitable rights. This idea,
which is undoubtedly startling, is supported by the
strange narrative of Hercules and Iphitus. Iphitus
was the possessor of certain fine mares. Hercules, determined
to possess them, visited him, received his hospitality,
slew him, and carried off the animals. Now it
may indeed be the mixed character of Hercules, which
places his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴδωλον</span> in the Shades, while he is himself
among the Immortals; but still the scale is cast on
the whole in his favour. Yet surely the story of
Iphitus exhibits a crime of the blackest dye; and the
only palliation of it that is conceivable seems to lie in
this, that he probably did not use stratagem, but proceeded
by main force. The crime of Ægisthus, the
blackest in the poems, appears to derive its highest
intensity from the fact, that he slew Agamemnon like
an ox at the stall, in the friendly feast itself, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
notice or the opportunity of defence, and by a plot
deliberately laid. Such is the effect of all the three
passages in which this outrage is described<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>. The
most favourable supposition which the case of Hercules
admits is, that he came for plunder, and put the possessor
of the horses to death, without premeditation,
upon his refusal to yield them up; and that such an
act, though a proper object of divine resentment, was
yet not black enough to destroy his title to honour
and a celestial abode<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>.</p>

<p>We will now pass on to a kindred subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Piracy in the heroic age.</i></div>

<p>Thucydides has stated that in the earlier ages of
Greece the practice of piracy was alike widespread
and honourable: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἔχοντός πω αἰσχύνην τούτου τοῦ
ἔργου, φέροντος δέ τι καὶ δόξης μᾶλλον</span><a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>. In support of
this opinion he refers to the questions then usually
addressed to strangers on their arrival in a country;
such as that by Nestor to the pseudo-Mentor and
Telemachus, in order to learn what their business was,
or whether they were pirates<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent20">ἢ μαψιδίως ἀλάλησθε,</div>
       <div class="verse">οἷά τε ληϊστῆρες, ὑπεὶρ ἅλα, τοίτ’ ἀλόωνται</div>
       <div class="verse">ψυχὰς παρθέμενοι, κακὸν ἀλλοδαποῖσι φέροντες;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now I think that the last line seems to explain the
favourable view which was taken by the Greeks of the
practice of piracy. For it combined with the hazards of
navigation, then so much more serious than at present,
the chance of desperate encounters. It appealed, in
the very highest degree, to the spirit of adventure;
a spirit congenial especially to the earliest youth of a
people full of unsatisfied and, so to speak, hungry
energies. The mischief inflicted was inflicted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλλόδαποι</span>, on those with whom there was no close tie,
either as compatriots or as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξεῖνοι</span>. Now we must bear
in mind that the law which, even in the time of Thucydides,
governed the relations of the Greek tribes
among themselves, during the period of their high civilization,
was a permanent or ordinary state of hostility
suspended from time to time by conventions for so
many or so many years<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>. The same principle, applied
to a period when political organization was less mature,
and when men lived rather in knots and companies than
in states, involves the Homeric view of piracy. And
that view, entertained in such times, should occasion far
less surprise, than our finding Thucydides inform us
that the same system continued throughout whole divisions
of Greece in his day; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καὶ μέχρι τοῦδε πολλὰ τῆς
Ἑλλάδος τῷ παλαιῷ τρόπῳ νέμεται, περί τε Λοκροὺς τοὺς
Ὀζόλας, καὶ Αἰτώλους, καὶ Ἀκαρνᾶνας, καὶ τὴν ταύτῃ
ἤπειρον</span><a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>. The gains of the pirate’s life were in some
sense fairly balanced by its dangers. The piracy of
that age was not like piracy in ours, the strong and
well-armed waiting for the feeble and defenceless;
it was a game of more even chances, and the real
resemblance for it is to be found, not among the
Algerine corsairs, not even in the Highland clans
sweeping down from the mountains upon the Lowland
Scots, but most properly in the more even-handed
forays of the border warfare between England and
Scotland.</p>

<p>There is indeed yet a higher authority for this kind
of piracy, than that to which Thucydides has referred.
Ulysses, when he has destroyed the Suitors, considers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
in conversation with his wife, not only how he is to
preserve his remaining property in live stock, but how
he is to replace what his enemies have destroyed.
Part he thinks his subjects will make up to him by
presents, but great part he will himself obtain by freebooting<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">πολλὰ μὲν αὐτὸς ἐγὼ ληΐσσομαι.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We can hardly, I think, restrain the meaning of the
word to the booty of legitimate and successful war. Sometimes,
as in the case of the Cicones, piracy is scarcely
distinguishable from war; but Ulysses fairly relates of
himself a piratical attack upon Egypt, which can leave
us no room for scruple in supposing, that he might
without hesitation think of doing again what he thought
it worth while to pretend that he had done before.
Both these last-named instances may serve, however,
to show that, in times when preparedness for war was
habitual, the pirate took no great advantage in such
attacks as these. For with the Cicones Ulysses had
the worst of it at last<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>; and in the case of Egypt, according
to his fable, the whole party were taken prisoners
or slain. Kidnapping, however, such as that of Eumæus
stolen in his childhood, is not, I presume, to be
regarded as equal in honour to freebooting with the
strong hand, thus apparently stamped with the sanction
of Ulysses.</p>

<p>And yet this model-man had been stung to the very
quick by Euryalus in Phæacia, who said to him, ‘You
do not look like a man to compete in athletic games;
but rather like one of the captains of merchant vessels,
who looks after the cargo and makes rapacious
profits<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>!’</p>

<p>Nor, after all, is this so strange as at first sight it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
might appear; for the Phœnicians, the merchants of
those days, were also kidnappers and slave-dealers: and
if their transactions were not, like those of the pirates,
uniformly bad, they were, when exceptionable, double-dyed
in guilt, because they involved fraud as well as
robbery.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mixed view of it in the poems.</i></div>

<p>Again, as to piracy, it by no means appears that it
was attended with respect, nor is the language of the
poems quite uniform regarding it. In the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεκυία</span> of the
Twenty-fourth Odyssey, and also in that of the
Eleventh, the shade of Agamemnon calls freebooters of
this description <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάρσιοι ἄνδρες</span><a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>. The Cretan piracy of
the pseudo-Ulysses in Egypt is mentioned as an act of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕβρις</span>, an outrage deservedly punished by Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>. On
the other hand, Greek trade, like Phœnician, embraced
kidnapping. At least the Taphians carried away from
her country the Phœnician nurse, who in her turn carried
off the young Eumæus.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, after allowing liberally for the
masculine character and redundant energies of the
Hellenic people, we shall best explain their favourable
view of piracy by remembering the near relation it
then bore both to war, which we know may be just and
honourable, as well as to trade, which we regard as in
itself both innocent and beneficial. Since Homer’s
time the character of war has been softened, and that
of trade has been elevated, almost immeasurably;
while that of piracy has been lowered; hence there
is now a wide gulf, where there was then scarcely
even a seam discernible; and Homer might have sung
the expressive words of Goëthe in Faust,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="de" xml:lang="de">
       <div class="verse">Krieg, Handel, und Piraterie</div>
       <div class="verse">Dreieinig sind sie, nicht zu trennen.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>We may also, I think, find among the Greeks a tendency
to family feuds, beyond certain limits, of which the
poems do not afford any instance on the Trojan side.</p>

<p>Of these, two have already been noticed among the
homicides. Medon kills his father’s wife’s kinsman.
Tlepolemus kills his grand-uncle. But also Phœnix for
a quarrel flies from his father’s home and settles in
Dolopia. Phyleus, the father of Meges, for a similar
reason migrates to Dulichium<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>. Eurystheus, as the
great grandson of Jupiter, is of reputed kin to Hercules
his son; but persecutes him through life with the
imposition of cruel and endless toils. Meleager has
a fierce feud with his family, which is recited by
Phœnix as a warning to Achilles. Bellerophon is expelled
from Greece by a family quarrel. Ægisthus
himself is the cousin of Agamemnon.</p>

<p>As with families, so with communities. The pre-Troic
legends are almost invariably legends of the
internal raids and wars of Greece. They were a people
of the strong and the red hand, marvellously combined
with high refinement, true love of art and song, and an
unexampled political genius.</p>

<p>But although the Homeric age had not ceased to be
as yet an age of violence, it was as far as possible from
being one marked by a general sway either of unbridled
appetite, or of ungovernable passion; and if
it is sometimes mistakenly supposed to have borne this
character, the appearances which produce the illusion
are due only to the fact, that vice of all kinds then went
straight forward to its work, and had not yet learned,
in the school of the wisdom of this world, how much it
might gain from method, order, and reserve.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Temperance in the heroic age.</i></div>

<p>We have ample signs of that regard for temperance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
bodily as well as mental, which Homer united with his
thoroughly convivial spirit. By the mouth of Ulysses,
he reprehends even that mild form of excess in wine
which does no more than promote garrulity (Od. xiv.
463&ndash;6). When the Greeks were about to suffer
great calamities on their return, he makes them
proceed in a state of drunkenness to the Assembly<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>.
When Elpenor dies by an accidental fall, he assigns
drunkenness as the cause, and takes care to inform us
that he was young, and neither valiant nor sensible<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>.
Ulysses encourages the brutal Polyphemus to drink, with
a view to his own liberation. And the proceedings of
the monster, when intoxicated, are certainly more revolting
than those of Stephano, if not than those of Caliban,
in the Tempest. Again, though it is certainly true,
that the most vivid denunciation of excess in liquor to
be found throughout the poems is put into the mouth
of the Suitor Antinous<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>, yet I think it was plainly meant
to be accepted as spoken in earnest, and as expressing
the sense of Homer. Wine, we thus learn, caused
the Centaur Eurytion to lose his ears and nose. In no
single case does the Poet permit liquor to act in the
slightest degree upon the self-possession of his heroes,
or of any character whom he esteems; or represent them
as either doing, or leaving undone, any act through excess
in drink<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>. The only allusion to its influence, in
connection with a practical result, is one very faint, and
perfectly innocent. It is when, dissatisfaction having
prevailed among the Grecian kings and army, as we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
from the speech of Diomed, Nestor recommends Agamemnon
to treat his Council to a supper, before proceeding
to obtain their advice; and observes to him, that
he can readily do it, for he has wine and all other provision
in abundance. The intention apparently is to lay
the ground for concord, not in excess, nor even here
in hilarity, but at least in amicable humour<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>. To the
Immortals, indeed, it is conceded to abide at the banquet
for the livelong day, but not to men; for the
pseudo-Mentor observes to Nestor in the Third Odyssey,
that it is not seemly to sit long at the sacred (that is,
regular and public) feast<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that Horace, who in
many cases has shown himself an accurate reader of
Homer, has in this point grossly mistaken him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
       <div class="verse">Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And this summary character, unfortunately false, has
saved men the trouble of collecting the true one from
the works of the Poet himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Self-control in the heroic age.</i></div>

<p>When we turn to another form of temperance or
self-government, namely, that which we call self-control,
we find it eminently exemplified among
Greeks. It appears as a pervading and national quality
in that silence on the field of battle, which they combined
with such an inward energy of determination.
In Ulysses it is carried up to its perfection. Perhaps
the only occasions on which he even seems to relax it
are those of the answer to Euryalus in the Eighth
Odyssey, and the reply to Agamemnon in the Fourth
Iliad.</p>

<p>So much, however, of emotion as he suffers to escape
him in those passages, only serves to heighten the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
of his words, not to make him deflect by one jot or tittle,
though in undoubted warmth, from the true rule of
reason. But we find this quality not only developed
powerfully in a pattern-man like Ulysses; it is also
strongly infused into such a warrior as Diomed. This
is proved by the manner in which he bears<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> the chiding
of Agamemnon on his rounds, and rebukes Sthenelus
for having been provoked into a petulant answer. At
the same time it is highly illustrative of the national
character, that this young and ardent warrior, who
could thus bear a reprimand on the field, stored up
the recollection of it within his breast: and when, at
the beginning of the Ninth Book, Agamemnon showed
his own faint-heartedness by advising the abandonment
of the enterprise, then Diomed, having watched
his opportunity, recalled the circumstances, and quietly
but effectively replied upon Agamemnon<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>. Nay more,
perhaps the most striking proof of the abundance of
this high quality among the Greeks is in the very case
where it is on the whole outmatched by the passion
that it ought to master, namely, in the case of Achilles.
There is something indeed sublime in the manner in
which, many times over, when he feels the tide of wrath
rising within him, he eyes his own passion, even as a
tiger is eyed by its keeper, and puts a spell upon it, so
that it dare not spring. Thus it is, when he parleys
with himself on the question, whether he shall end the
strife with Agamemnon by slaying him, in the Assembly
of the First Book. And thus again, when he
feels that the words which Priam has incautiously let
drop are kindling a flame which, if further fed, would
consume the aged and sorrowing suppliant, he is con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>scious
of the rising tempest, and before it has swollen
to such force as to disturb his self-command, he sternly,
but yet not unkindly, bids him to desist. It is by
trying them in mental conflicts like these, that Homer
shows us of what mettle his Greek kings were made.
It would be curious to draw out a list of the multitude
of words in which he describes, under every possible
aspect, the power and habit of self-control. But perhaps
one of his slightest is also one of his most effective
touches. The applause of the Greeks in their Assembly
is always described by a word different from that employed
to describe the very same indication of feeling
by the Trojans. He usually says <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ δ’ ἴαχον υἷες Ἀχαιῶν</span>
for the Greeks: for the Trojans it is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ δὲ Τρῶες κελάδησαν</span>.
The Greeks shout forth their energetic approval:
the Trojans clatter, as if their tongues could not
bear restraint.</p>

<p>Yet we must not suppose, either on account of the
self-command of the Greeks that they were apathetic,
or on account of their frequent homicides that they
were inhuman, and savagely indifferent to the infliction
of pain on their fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Neither the Greeks nor the Trojans appear to have
been ferocious in the treatment of enemies. The extreme
point to which they go is that of giving no
quarter: but they never, even in the exasperation of
battle, inflict torture with their weapons. The immolation
of twelve Trojan youths over the dead Patroclus
is doubtless cruel: but it falls far short of what the
passions of war have produced in other times and
countries. With the manner of inflicting death, passion
never has to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Savage ideas occasionally expressed.</i></div>

<p>An inquiry, however, which seems to be most curious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
is suggested by the passages in which Hecuba wishes
that she could eat Achilles<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>, Achilles that he could
find it in his heart to devour Hector<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>; and again in
which Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> suggests to Juno, that nothing could
satiate her spite against Troy so well as if she were to
eat up Priam and his whole family. For the question
arises, how is it that we find these remains of the wildest
savagery in company with a refinement of manners
and feeling, which the poems very frequently exhibit,
and which even reaches in some important points to
a degree never exceeded in any country or any period
of the world?</p>

<p>The answer I presume to be this: that the civilization
of the Greeks in the heroic age, though as to the
mind it was really a very high, was yet also a very
young civilisation. Its path was marked and decided,
but it had not had time to travel far from barbarism.
It was not safe by distance, nor defended by the ramparts
of long tradition, nor strengthened by the force
of continuing bent, and consolidated immemorial habit.
The Homeric gentleman, with his civilization, stood, in
respect to barbarism, like him who voyages by sea,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
       <div class="verse indent16">digitis a morte remotus</div>
       <div class="verse">Quatuor aut septem;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>only the thickness of the plank is between him and
the wilderness which he has left: and if passion makes
a breach, the mood of the wild beast reappears. We
may account for the cannibalish observation of Jupiter
by the fact that he has no self-control in Homer: but
that of Hecuba is to be accounted for on the principle
I have endeavoured to describe. So it is with Achilles:
and so, too, when the wise Ulysses, slaughtering the
wretched women of his household who had erred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
seems tinged for once with a flush of barbarism. When
<i>we</i> let loose the tiger within us, his range is limited
not by any force springing from our own will or choice,
but by the strong dikes and barriers of social wont,
and by habits of thought as well as action, which have
been accumulated by the long labours of many successive
generations of mankind.</p>

<p>We have already<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> noticed something that will well
bear comparison with this state of things in the reports
which are made to us respecting modern Persia, the
cradle in all likelihood of the family of Achilles.</p>

<p>At the same time it is to be borne in mind that this
cannibalism, of which we have glimpses in Homer, in
the first place was limited, even in speculation, to enemies;
and in the second place, existed in speculation
only. Of this we have pretty strong proof from the
case of the crew of Ulysses in the Twelfth Odyssey.
They did not touch the oxen of the Sun, until death
from hunger stared them in the face. Then Eurylochus
made a manful speech on the subject of the
option before them, between dying on the one side,
and the slaughter of some of the animals on the other.
But those circumstances of the last extremity, to which
they were reduced, were the very circumstances in
which the fortitude even of Christians<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> has given way,
and with respect to which no prudent man dares to
pronounce a judgment upon persons that so succumb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
Yet there is not in the case before us the slightest
hint at a resort to this most horrible remedy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Not unfamiliar to later Greece.</i></div>

<p>Besides the circumstance, that in Homer the cannibal
<i>dicta</i>, abstractedly so shocking, are the mere
words of phrensied passion, and that there are no corresponding
acts, we have to observe that the Poet is
never found exhibiting the sentiment of joy in connection
with the positive infliction of suffering upon an
enemy. It was by no means so among the later
Greeks. Too many instances might, indeed, be supplied
of the increase of cruelty with the lapse of
time.</p>

<p>Homer, again, has nowhere made woman to be even
the sorrowing minister of justice: as if he felt that
there was a radical incompatibility between the proper
gentleness of her nature, and the use of the sword of
punishment. But in the Hecuba of Euripides, after the
aged matron, exasperated by the treacherous murder of
her son Polydorus, has put to death the two children
of the assassin Polymestor, and has likewise put out
his eyes, he addresses to her these words (v. 1233),</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">χαίρεις ὑβρίζουσ’ εἰς ἔμ’, ὦ πανοῦργε σύ·</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and she, no way shrinking from the imputation, replies</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">οὐ γάρ με χαίρειν χρὴ, σὲ τιμωρουμένην;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In one place Homer has taken an opportunity of
showing us, what he thinks of the principle of exultation
over fallen enemies. When Euryclea is about to
shout over the fallen Suitors, Ulysses, though he has
not yet ended the bloody work of retribution, gravely
checks her. ‘It is wrong,’ he says, ‘to exult over the
slain. These men have been overtaken by divine providence,
and by their own perverse deeds: for they
regarded no human being, noble or vile, with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
they had to do: wherefore they have miserably perished
in their wickedness.’ The whole tone and language of
this rebuke, so grave and earnest as it is, and more sad
even than it is stern, is worthy of any moral code that
the world has known.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wrath in Ulysses and in Achilles.</i></div>

<p>There is indeed a terrible severity in the proceedings
of Ulysses against the Suitors, the women, and his rebellious
subjects. But it is plain that the case, which
Homer had to represent, was one that required the hero
to effect something like a reconquest of the country. It
is also plain that Homer felt that these stern measures
would require a very strong warrant. Hence without
doubt it is, that the preparations for the crisis are so
elaborate; the insults offered to the disguised master
of the palace so aggravated; and the direct agency of
Minerva introduced to deepen his sufferings. Hence,
again, when the incensed warrior is about to pursue
with martial ardour the flying insurgents, his eagerness
is mildly marked as excessive, and is effectually
checked by the friendly but decisive intervention of
Jupiter. Some critics have objected to this passage,
and have argued that it could not be genuine. They
surely must forget, that Homer does not seek to present
us in his protagonists with a faultlessness which
would have carried them out of the sphere, such as it
was conceived by him and by his age, of life either divine
or human. Both Ulysses and Achilles may err. But
where they err, it is in measure and degree. Ulysses is
the minister of public justice, and of divine retribution.
But he is composed, like ourselves, of flesh and blood,
and he carries his righteous office, in a natural heat, to
the verge of cruelty. Then the warning voice is vouchsafed
to him, and he at once dutifully obeys. And is,
then, a thing like this so new and strange to us? And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
has neither our philosophy nor our experience of life
taught us that there are no circumstances, in which a
good and just man runs so serious a risk of becoming
harsh and cruel unawares, as when he is hurried along
by the torrent of an originally righteous indignation?</p>

<p>Even so with Achilles. He is, no more than Ulysses,
merely vengeful, but he resents a wrong done to justice,
to decency, and to love, in his person. Upon the
stream of this resentment he is carried, until it threatens
to become a torrent. Then, by an admirable design, he
is chastised in the yet deeper passion of his soul, his
friendship for Patroclus; and so is recalled within the
bounds of his duty to his suffering countrymen.</p>

<p>But in both cases the foundation of conduct is just
and sound: by neither is any sanction given to the
principle which the Gospel rebukes, ‘an eye for an
eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ For a wrong done to
principles of public morality and justice is in each case
alike the thing chiefly resented, although in each case
the person who resents it is also a person that had
greatly suffered by it.</p>

<p>Again, we should misunderstand Homer’s picture of
the Greek character, if we conceived that he left no
room in it for those accesses of emotion, with respect
to which it may be difficult to say whether they contributed
most to its strength or its weakness, while it
seems clear that they are in near association with
both.</p>

<p>The Poet’s intention does not oblige him to place his
protagonists beyond the reach of human infirmity, as
we see in the stubborn wrath of Achilles, and in the
awakened keenness of Ulysses for the blood of his rebellious
subjects<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a>. And though he never exhibits them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
as vicious, still, in the case of Ulysses, as well as in that
of Achilles, he has introduced into his picture great
quickness of temper, which is indeed nearly, though
not necessarily, connected with sensitiveness of honour.
On two occasions in particular is this observable: in
the sharp answers namely of Ulysses, first to Agamemnon,
who on his circuit accuses him of remissness in
military duty<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>; and secondly to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυμοδακὴς μῦθος</span> of
Euryalus<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>, who has taken him for a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρήκτηρ</span> or merchant,
and a rogue to boot.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Domestic affections.</i></div>

<p>The point in which the ethical tone of the heroic
age stands highest of all is, perhaps, the strength of the
domestic affections.</p>

<p>A marked indication of the power of this principle
among mankind is to be found in its prevalence even
among the Olympian deities. For its appearance there
has no relation to divine attributes properly so called;
it is strictly a part of the mythology; a sentiment
copied from the human heart and life, and transferred
to these inventive or idealized formations. Indeed we
always find it in connection with that in which they
are most human, namely, the indulgence of their sensual
passions, and the results of that indulgence in their
human progeny. It is not, therefore, among the higher
or traditive deities that we find the sentiment; it does
not exist in Apollo or Minerva, whose love is always of
a different kind, and is grounded in the gifts or character
of the person who is the object of it, as for instance,
the great Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>, or, in a smaller sphere, the
skilful Phereclus, who built the ships of Paris<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>. It is
in Jupiter over Sarpedon, in Neptune for the blindness
of his brutal son Polyphemus, in Mars over Ascalaphus,
in Venus about Æneas; and these two last are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
the two deities whose ethical and intellectual standard
is the lowest of all<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>.</p>

<p>When we come down to earth, we find the sentiment
strong everywhere. Among the Trojan royal
family, where there is but little sense of the higher
parts of morality, this feeling is intense alike with
Priam and with Hecuba. The latter is not passionate,
she is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠπιόδωρος</span><a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>. Yet on the death of Hector we see
her become a tigress, and wish she could devour the
conqueror<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>. Ulysses chooses for the title by which he
would be known that of the Father of Telemachus<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>.
It is true indeed that, then as now, the imperiousness of
bodily wants made itself felt; and it was then more ingenuously
acknowledged. Hence Telemachus, attached
to his father, when he explained the double cause of
his grief and care to the Ithacan assembly, first named
the death or absence of his father, but then proclaimed
as the chief matter, the continuing waste and threatened
destruction of his property<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">νῦν δ’ αὖ καὶ πολὺ μεῖζον ὃ δὴ τάχα οἶκον ἅπαντα</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>And the gist of his complaint against the Suitors was,
not their urging Penelope to marry, but their living
upon him while prosecuting the suit<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>. But then this
is a father, whom he has never known or consciously
seen. The Shade of Achilles in the nether world is
anxious upon one subject: it is that he may know if
old Peleus is still held in honour. In another he is also
deeply interested; it is the valour of his son: and the
gloom of his chill existence is brightened into an exult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>ing
joy, when he learns that Neoptolemus is great in
fight<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>. The mother of Ulysses died neither of disease

of her son<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>. But the most signal proof of the power
of the instinct is in its hold upon the self-centred
character of Agamemnon, which, as a general rule,
leaves no room in his thoughts for anything, except
policy alone, that lies beyond the range of his personal
propensities and especially his appetite for wealth. But
when the gallant Menelaus, ashamed of the silence of
his countrymen, accepts the challenge of Hector<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>,
Agamemnon seizes him by the hand, and beseeches
him not to run so terrible a hazard. And again, in
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δολώνεια</span>, when Diomed has to select a companion,
Agamemnon, in dread lest his choice should fall on
Menelaus, desires him to take not the man of highest
rank, but the most valiant and effective companion for
an enterprise of so critical a kind. His motive was
apprehension for the safety of his brother<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>:</p>

<p>The war too is full of the most pleasing instances
of attachment between brothers; Ajax and Teucer,
Glaucus and Sarpedon, and many other instances less
illustrious, might be quoted. It is the sad end of Polydorus
which at the last works up Hector into the most
daring heroism; and again in the Odyssey, the advantage
is set forth of having brothers, who defend a man
while he is living, and avenge him when he is dead<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>.</p>

<p>And hence it is that, even though Greeks were hot
of head and ready of hand, we find no instance where,
in consequence of a broil, one member of a family inflicts
violence or death upon another of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
household. The horrible idea of parricide, and the execration
with which public opinion would brand such a
crime, restrain Phœnix at the very height of his passion
from laying hands upon his father<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὡς μὴ πατροφόνος μετ’ Ἀχαιοῖσιν καλεοίμην.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Directly that we pass beyond the household and its
affections intertwined by habit, the aspect of the case
alters. Out of six instances of unpremeditated homicide
in Homer, three<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> are committed upon relations
by blood or by affinity, though not very near ones.
Medon, the bastard of Oileus, kills a relation of the
lawful wife. Tlepolemus the son of Hercules kills his
grand-uncle Licymnius. Epeigeus of Budeum kills
his cousin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Relationships close, not wide.</i></div>

<p>This marked line of distinction, between the homicides
of crime and the homicides of misfortune, illustrates
another point in the structure of Greek society.
Relationships do not appear to have been reckoned by
them as subsisting beyond a rather narrow range. We
cannot trace any defined idea of kin more remote than
the first cousin. The lexicographers treat the term
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνέψιος</span> as capable of a wider sense; but the only individuals
named as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνέψιοι</span> by Homer, whose relationships
we can follow, are first cousins: namely, Caletor
son of Clytius, and Dolops son of Lampus, both first
cousins of Hector<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>. There are also persons named in
the poems, whose consanguinity we can trace, while it
is nowhere noticed by the Poet: for instance, Eumelus
is first cousin, once removed, to Nestor. Priam and
Anchises are second cousins: Æneas and Hector third.
These relationships are never referred to. Thus then
society is not arranged in clans, but in tribes, united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
by the general sense of a common name, a common
abode, a common history, a common religion, and a remote
sense of a common tribal stock, without any sense
of personal affinity in each individual case. Again, it
is curious to observe that the xenial relation was not
less vivacious than that of blood. The tie of blood
subsists in the second generation from the common
ancestor; and Diomed and Glaucus similarly own one
another as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξεῖνοι</span>, because two generations before Œneus
had entertained Bellerophon<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Purity in the heroic age.</i></div>

<p>The elevated and free social position of womankind
in the Homeric times of itself implies a great purity of
ideas respecting them. This subject, however, will receive
a separate discussion.</p>

<p>There is a passage of Athenæus which conveys to us a
tradition of no ordinary beauty, and effectually severs
for us ideas and objects which only a corrupt bias has
associated. He tells us that Zeno of Citium<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>, whatever
the practice of the Stoic leader may have been, conceived
of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἔρως</span>, the God of Love, as a deity of friendship,
liberty, concord, and public happiness, and of nothing
else. So likewise his antecessors in philosophy taught
that this deity was as a being perfectly pure: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σεμνόν
τινα καὶ παντὸς αἰσχροῦ κεχωρισμένον</span>. This idea took
refuge in the Venus <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Οὐρανία</span>, the opposite one in the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πάνδημος</span>, or promiscuous<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>. In the later ages of Greece,
the distinction of these two characters one from the
other feebly lived on: but there was no subjective
basis for the separate existence of the former, and
it was practically eclipsed, if not absorbed. The
true severance of the ideas probably was effected
before the time of Homer; and they were lodged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
separate impersonations. The effective form of the
Celestial Venus is to be sought most probably in Diana,
though it was natural for Plato and the philosophers
to keep alive the memory of the distinction by way of
apology for the popular religion. The traces of this unstained
conception were in later times only to be found
in the sphere of art, and were even there not always visible:
but in the Homeric poems, and probably in the Homeric
period, this purity of admiring sentiment towards
beautiful form appears to have been a living reality.</p>

<p>Our inquiry on this subject must have reference
partly to the Poet, and partly to his period and nation.
I will first deal with the points which have a bearing
upon the age as well as the bard: and will thereafter
subjoin what appears to touch Homer only.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lay of the Net of Vulcan.</i></div>

<p>Let us commence, then, by considering that one
and only case, in the whole compass of twenty-eight
thousand lines, which might lead to an opposite conclusion:
the case of the second Lay of Demodocus, or
the adultery of Mars and Venus<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>.</p>

<p>Of course it is impossible to justify this single passage
upon its own merits: but there are many circumstances
that ought to be borne in mind by those who
wish to form an accurate judgment upon it in its connection
with the morals either of the Poet himself, or
of the age to which he belonged.</p>

<p>Of these the most important, in my view, is the tendency
which the Pagan religion already powerfully
showed to become itself the positive corrupter of morality,
or, to speak perhaps more accurately, to afford the
medium, through which the forces of evil and the downward
inclination would principally act for the purpose
of depraving it. Even in Homer’s time, the existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
mythology contained ample warrant for the scene of
indulgence here laid bare; and we see the remaining
modesty and delicacy of mankind feebly resisting the
torrent of passion, which ought to have been counteracted,
but which, on the contrary, was principally
swollen and impelled, by the agency of the acknowledged
religion of the country.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Homer to be altogether above
the operation of influences so closely allied with an origin
believed to be celestial: nor could it be easy for the
popular Poet wholly to disregard the tastes of his hearers:
the Poet, whose strains swept over the whole height
and depth of life and nature, both human and divine,
could not absolutely shut out from his encyclopædic survey
so marked a characteristic of Olympian habits. He
has not omitted to mark as peculiar, in more ways than
one, the licence he has assumed. The lay is sung in an
assembly attended by men only: and it purports also to
describe a scene, from which the goddesses intentionally
kept away. The amusement of the deities present is
not universal: Neptune, the senior one among them,
does not laugh<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>, but takes the matter gravely, and desires
to put an end to the scandal, by promising to make
to the injured husband a pecuniary reparation<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>. He
evidently appears to act under an impulse of offended
dignity at least, though not of modesty. Again, the
Poet endeavours to give a ridiculous air, not only a
laughable one, to the whole proceeding, through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
extreme mortification of the guilty persons; who, when
released, are made to disappear in real dismay and discomfiture<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>.
In this point he altogether differs, undoubtedly,
from the generality of the writers of licentious
pieces, as materially as he does in the simplicity
of his details; and that supposition of a partially moral
aim on which some have ventured, is not so extravagant
as to deserve total and absolute rejection.</p>

<p>It has been common to employ, in vindication of
Homer, the supposition that the passage is spurious.
There is something rather more marked in the personal
agency of the Sun than the poems elsewhere present;
and undoubtedly Apollo is made to assume a tone
wholly singular, and unsupported by what is told of him
in the rest of the poems. These are arguments, so far
as they go, against it. But I do not venture to adopt
this alluring expedient: for the general character of
the colouring, diction, and incidents, appears to be
Homeric enough. And again, if licentiousness was to
come in, this was exactly the way for its entrance, because
it was after a banquet; because it was among men
exclusively, and not in the presence of women; because
of the connection with mythology; and because the
tale is thoroughly in keeping with the mythological
character of the personages chiefly concerned.</p>

<p>The direct reference however of the evil to the influence
of a perverted religion can be supported by
distinct evidence from other parts of the poems. In
the Iliad there appear to be but two passages, which
can fairly be termed indelicate. One is the account of
the proceeding of Juno, with the accompanying speech
of Jupiter, in the Fourteenth Book<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>. This relation
belongs strictly to the mythology of the poem, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
is evidently handled in an historical manner; for Jupiter’s
details, at least as it seems to me, are introduced
for the purpose of fixing ancient national legends, as
much as the stories of Nestor and Phœnix. The other
passage is that, which in a few words contains the sensual
advice given by Thetis, as a mother, to her son
Achilles in his grief, by way of comfort;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent8">ἀγαθὸν δὲ γυναικί περ ἐν φιλότητι</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>This precisely exemplifies the relation of which I
speak. The deity teaches the debased lesson: the human
hero passes by the recommendation in silence.
Homer would have put no such language as this into
the mouth of one of his matrons.</p>

<p>When we come to pass sentence upon Homer, we
must remember that, since in the Odyssey he represents
the comic as well as the serious side of life, he ought in
justice to be first compared with his successors. And
here we not only shall find he gains by the comparison
with Aristophanes or with Horace, but that he gains
yet much more when tried by the standard of the
other great school of poets which followed him in associating
heroic subjects with wit and with amusement,
namely, the poets of the Italian romance. There is
hardly, perhaps, one of that whole school of Christian
writers, who has not descended to licentiousness of far
more malignant type. Nor let it be supposed that the
Æneid shows in this respect any superiority in Virgil
or in his hearers. As to Virgil, and as to his poems, if
we take the whole of them into view, I am afraid that
whatever the veil of words may do, the case was in
reality bad enough: as to the hearers of the Æneid, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
must remember that they were not a people, but a
court: we must compare his Roman auditors with the
hearers of Homer, not as to that particular only of their
public amusements, but as to the whole; that is, we
must compare the Homeric poems not with the Æneid
alone, but with the Æneid and the Floralia. In Homer’s
time, men had not learned to screen their vices behind
walls which also serve to fortify them. And it still
remains more than doubtful whether the appetite of
Homeric Greece would have endured the garbage on
which Christian Florence was content to feed, during
its carnivals, in the period of its most famous civilization.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Evidence of comparative purity.</i></div>

<p>From this scene let us turn to consider the evidence
for asserting the comparative purity of Homer’s age,
and the peculiar purity of his mind.</p>

<p>2. We find in Homer no trace whatever of the existence
of those unnatural vices, which appear to have
deeply tainted the lives of many of the most eminent
Greeks of later days<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>; which drew down the blasting
sentence of St. Paul<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>; which in early times had been
visited on the Cities of the plain; and which, it is no
less strange than horrible to think, have left their mark
upon more than one period or portion even of the literature
of Christendom, in a manner and degree such as
must excite scarcely less of surprise than shame.</p>

<p>The seizure of Ganymedes became in later times the
basis of a tradition of this kind: but there is not a
trace of it in Homer. The intense love and admiration
of beauty to which his pages bear constant witness
is wholly disconnected from animal passions, and in its
simplicity and earnestness is, for its combined purity
and strength, really nearer the feeling of some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
early Italian painters, and of Dante, than any thing
else I can recall.</p>

<p>This is the more remarkable when we bear in mind
what had already, and long before his time, happened
in the East, and is recorded for us in the Book of
Genesis.</p>

<p>Homer most rarely alludes to what is unbecoming in
the human form: in the case of woman not once, and
in the case of men only where he has a legitimate and
sufficient purpose. Thus when Ulysses<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> threatens to
strip Thersites to the skin in the event of his repeating
his turbulence and insolence, it is plainly with an honest
view to inflict upon him the last extremity of shame,
and to make him an object of general and wholly unmixed
disgust. Again, when Priam refers to the likelihood
that his own body may be stripped naked, and
then mangled by animals after his death, every one
feels that the insult to natural decency, which he anticipates,
contributes only to enhance the agony of his
feelings. And the scene in the Odyssey, where Ulysses
emerges from the sea upon the coast of Scheria, will
always be regarded as one of the most careful, and yet
most simple and unaffected, examples of true modesty
contained in the whole circle of literature. Now these
appear to be, not peculiarities, but samples of the
general manners. We should look in vain for the
proofs of an equal truth and fineness of perception
among the Hebrews or among their forefathers, unless
it be among a very few individuals, who, under a direct
teaching from above, became select examples of
virtue.</p>

<p>Many other indications in the poems converge upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
the same point. The horror with which incest was regarded
is one. The deep grief and humility stamped
on the character of Helen is a second. The manner
in which the chastity of Bellerophon is held up to
admiration, and followed by reward, is a third<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>. The
high-toned living widowhood of Penelope is of itself
conclusive on the point before us.</p>

<p>Homer’s subject in the Iliad was one, which tempted
and almost forced him into indecency, where he had to
refer to the original crime of Paris or to describe his
private life. The manner in which he has handled it is
deserving of all praise. He treats as an evil gift the
original promise and temptation to Paris. The scene
in the end of the Third Book was necessary in order
to complete the view of the character of that bad
prince: and it could not have been drawn in a manner
less calculated to seduce the mind, whether by the
management of its details, or by the sentiments of
loathing which it raises against the principal actor.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly we must, as regards the whole morality
of the poems, ascribe much to the praise of Homer personally:
yet it is plain that he represented his age in
no small degree. First, because, as a popular and
famous minstrel, he could not have been in sharp or
general contrast with the feeling of his contemporaries.
Secondly, because we perceive remains of this seriousness
and purity in the older Greek writers junior to
Homer. Thirdly, because we find from Thucydides
that, at the time when the original Olympian games
were instituted, it was still the custom carefully to
avoid the exposure of the human form, and that a
different practice was introduced afterwards by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
Lacedæmonians, probably without evil intention, and
for gymnastic ends alone (Thuc. i. 6).</p>

<p>And now, if we contemplate the belief, ideas, and
institutions of the heroic period, as they would work
upon an individual, we shall, perhaps, find that they
fully justify the outline with which this section began.
We may, indeed, see in the Homeric pictures of that
age much to condemn or to deplore; but we may also
be led to believe that if, through God’s mercy, there
have been happier, there also have been less happy
forms, for human destiny to be cast in.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Life of the high-born Greek.</i></div>

<p>The youth of high birth, not then so widely as now
separated from the low, is educated under tutors in
reverence for his parents, and in desire to emulate
their fame: he shares in manly and in graceful sports,
acquires the use of arms, hardens himself in the pursuit,
then, of all others the most indispensable, the
hunting down of wild beasts, gains the knowledge of
medicine, probably also of the lyre. Sometimes, with
many-sided intelligence, he even sets himself to learn
how to build his own house or ship, or how to drive the
plough firm and straight down the furrow, as well as to
reap the standing corn<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>. And when scarcely a man, he
bears arms for his country or his tribe, takes part in its
government, learns by direct instruction and by practice
how to rule mankind through the use of reasoning
and persuasive power in political assemblies,
attends and assists in sacrifices to the gods. For all
this time he has been in kindly and free relations, not
only with his parents, his family, his equals of his own
age, but with the attendants, although they are but
serfs, who have known him from infancy on his father’s
domain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>
<p>He is indeed mistaught with reference to the use of
the strong hand. Human life is cheap; so cheap that
even a mild and gentle youth may be betrayed, upon a
casual quarrel over some childish game with his friend,
into taking it away. And even so throughout his life,
should some occasion come that stirs up his passions
from their depths, a wild beast, as it were, awakes
within him, and he loses his humanity for the time
until reason has re-established her control. Short,
however, of such a desperate crisis, though he could
not for the world rob his friend or his neighbour, yet
he might be not unwilling to triumph over him to his
cost, for the sake of some exercise of signal ingenuity:
while, from a hostile tribe or a foreign shore, or from
the individual who has become his enemy, he will acquire
by main force what he can, nor will he scruple
to inflict on him by stratagem even deadly injury<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>.
He must, however, give liberally to those who are in
need; to the wayfarer, the poor, the suppliant who begs
from him shelter and protection. On the other hand,
should his own goods be wasted, the liberal and open-handed
contributions of his neighbours will not be
wanting to replace them.</p>

<p>His early youth is not solicited into vice by finding
sensual excess in vogue, or the opportunities of it
staring in his eye and sounding in his ear. Gluttony
is hardly known; drunkenness is marked only by its degrading
character and the evil consequences that flow
so straight from it, and is abhorred. But he loves the
genial use of meals, and rejoices in the hour when
the guests, gathered in his father’s hall, enjoy a liberal
hospitality, and the wine mantles in the cup<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>. For
then they listen to the strains of the minstrel, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
celebrates before them the newest and the dearest of
the heroic tales that stir their blood, and rouse their
manly resolution to be worthy, in their turn, of their
country and their country’s heroes. He joins the dance
in the festivals of religion; the maiden’s hand upon his
wrist, and the gilded knife glancing from his belt, as
they course from point to point, or wheel in round on
round<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>. That maiden, some Nausicaa or some Hermione
of a neighbouring district, in due time he weds,
amidst the rejoicings of their families, and brings her
home to cherish her, ‘from the flower to the ripeness
of the grape,’ with respect, fidelity, and love.</p>

<p>Whether as a governor or as governed, politics
bring him, in ordinary circumstances, no great share
of trouble. Government is a machine, of which the
wheels move easily; for they are well oiled by simplicity
of usages, ideas, and desires; by unity of interest;
by respect for authority, and for those in whose hands
it is reposed; by love of the common country, the common
altar, the common festivals and games, to which
already there is large resort. In peace he settles the
disputes of his people, in war he lends them the precious
example of heroic daring. He consults them, and
advises with them, on all grave affairs; and his wakeful
care for their interests is rewarded by the ample domains
which are set apart for the prince by the people<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>.
Finally, he closes his eyes, delivering over the sceptre
to his son, and leaving much peace and happiness
around him<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>.</p>

<p>Such was, probably, the state of society amidst the
concluding phase of which Homer’s youth, at least, was
passed. But a dark and deep social revolution seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
to have followed the Trojan war: we have its workings
already become visible in the Odyssey. Scarcely could
even Ulysses cope with it, contracted though it was for
him within the narrow bounds of Ithaca. On the mainland,
the bands of the elder society are soon wholly
broken. The Pelopid, Neleid, Œneid houses are a
wreck: disorganization invites the entry of new forces
to control it: the Dorian lances bristle on the Ætolian
beach, and the primitive Greece, the patriarchal Greece,
the Greece of Homer, is no more.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ethics of earlier and later Paganism.</i></div>

<p>When we take a general survey of the practical
morality of the Heroic age, and compare it with that
of later times, we must at once be struck with the
great superiority of the former, in all that most nearly
touches the moral being of man. The mere police of
society, indeed, improves with the advance of civilization.
The law of determinate rights to property, which
we rather dangerously call the law of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>,
whereas it is but a limited part of that great ordinance,
comes to be better understood in later times, and better
defended by penal sanctions. A clearer ideal, as well
as actual, distinction, is gradually established between
force and civil right. But who will venture to say
that the duties of man to the Deity, or the larger claims
of man upon man, were better understood in the age
of Pericles or Alexander, of Sylla or of Augustus, than
in the days of Homer?</p>

<p>It is to be expected that, when the elements of
wealth are for the most part such as nature offers, when
man has hardly left the mark of his hand upon the
earth, when little has been appropriated, and that little
indeterminately, then the description of right which is
least understood should also be least respected; namely,
the law which withdraws things from original community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
of use into individual dominion. To this day we dispute,
what was the pristine foundation of the law of
property. Why do we not perceive that this is equivalent
to an admission, that in the first periods of political
society, the whole idea of property must of necessity
have been more or less vague? And consequently,
that even plunder in primitive times is a different
thing from plunder in later times, not only as to public
estimation, but as to the moral colour of the act, and
that it should be judged accordingly?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Points of superiority in the former.</i></div>

<p>Let us then consider the notes of moral superiority
which the Heroic age of Greece presents to us.</p>

<p>Human sacrifices were not then offered upon bloody
altars to the gods. Not even the direst extremity of
suffering suggested the thought of cannibalism as an
alternative of escape from death<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>. Wailing infants
were not then exposed to avoid the burden of their
nurture. The grey hairs of parents were treated with
reverence and care; and if their weakness brought
down insult upon them, it stung the souls of their
children, even after death. To age in general a deep
and hearty reverence was paid by the young. Woman,
the grand refining element of society, had not then
been put down in the estimation of any man, far less
of the wisest men, to the level of persons degraded by
the habits of captivity, and was not held to be a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζῶον
ἔμψυχον</span>. Slavery itself was mild and almost genial.
It implied the law of labour, and possibly, in ordinary
cases, a prohibition to rise in life: but of positive oppression,
and of suffering in connection with it, or of
any penal system directed to its maintenance, we have
no trace whatever. Marriage was the honourable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
single tie between man and his helpmate<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>. Connections
with very near relations were regarded with horror; the
wife was the representative, the intelligent companion
and friend, of her husband; adultery was held in aversion,
a crime rarer then than in most after-periods: and
the sacred bond between husband and wife was not
liable to be broken by the poor invention of divorce.</p>

<p>Organized unchastity had not then become a kind of
devil’s law for society. The very name and nature of
unnatural lusts appear to have been unknown in
Greece, centuries after Sodom had been smitten for its
crimes. The detestable invention, which set gladiators
to kill one another for the amusement of enraptured
spectators, was reserved for times more vain of their
philosophy and their artificial culture. The rights of
the poor were acknowledged in the form of an unlimited
obligation to relieve them, under pain of the divine
displeasure: and no stranger or suppliant could be repelled
from the door of any one, who regarded either
the fear of God or the fear of man.</p>

<p>As respects the gods, the remains of ancient piety
still in some degree checked the activity of the critical
faculty, and the reverence for the Power that disposes
events and hates the wicked was not yet derided by
speculation, nor wholly buried beneath fable and corruption.
True, sacrifice was regarded as the indispensable
and effective basis of religion: but in general, as
between Greek and Greek, those who were most careful
of virtue were also most regular in their offerings.
Men were believers in prayer: they thought that, if in
need they humbly betook themselves to supplication,
they would be heard and helped. In short,
they kept their hold upon a higher power, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
see to have been real, because they resorted to it at
those times when human nature eschews illusion, and
cries out for reality. Ulysses, in affliction or in need,
addresses himself to the gods: even Ægisthus, when
alarmed, begins to think much of them: but Cicero or
Quintilian, when the arrow of grief has touched them
to the quick, seek for comfort in philosophical calculations
on the great woe and little weal of life.</p>

<p>Yet, even while all this was so, there lay in the accumulating
mythology the thickly scattered seeds of
destruction, both for belief and for duty. How could
marriage continue single, pure, or permanent, in the
face of the promiscuous lusts of Jupiter? Why should
not helpless infants be exposed, when Juno, disgusted
with the form of Vulcan, threw him down into the
sea? Why should not man make a joyous spectacle of
blood and wounds, when they were already beheld
with amusement by the highest of the gods? The
examples of rebellion, of discord, of luxury and selfish
ease, were all of them ready to forward the process of
corruption among men; and this armoury of curses was
prepared too in the very quarter, where his eye should
behold nothing but what is august and pure.</p>

<p>Again. In all descriptions of tender feelings the
Greeks of the Homeric age are much nearer than those
of later times to the standard of truth and nature.</p>

<p>The heroes of Homer weep freely; but, says the
Agamemnon of Euripides<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>, while he complains of the
restriction, weeping is the recognised privilege of
humble life only;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἡ δυσγένεια τ’ ὡς ἔχει τι χρήσιμον·</div>

       <div class="verse">ἔγω γὰρ ἐκβαλεῖν μὲν αἰδοῦμαι δάκρυ.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>
<p>And Aristotle thought, as is thought now, that weeping
was unfit for men. The wise man, he conceives<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>, cannot
incite others to mourn with him, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὸ μηδ’ αὐτὸς εἶναι
θρηνητικός</span>: but women, and woman-like men, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γύναια
καὶ οἱ τοιοῦτοι ἄνδρες</span>, are glad of such companionship in
sorrow.</p>

<p>There are indeed three most important points of the
Homeric poems, in which it would appear that the
Greek character greatly hardened, and greatly sank, as
the nation advanced in its career. One of them is the
principle of sympathy. Another is that of placability,
which Homer has very powerfully exhibited in Achilles.
The third is that of humility, of which we have an example
in Helen, in the Helen of Troy and the Helen
of Sparta, such as heathenism nowhere else, I believe,
presents to us.</p>

<p>It has thus appeared that if we take the state of
morality as it appears among mankind in the poems of
Homer, and compare it with that of Greece in its
highest civilization, we find before us two grand differences.
Those offences against the moral law, which
constitute crimes of violence, were more justly appreciated
at the later period; but as to those which constitute,
in the language of Christianity, the lusts of the
mind and of the flesh, a great preference is due to the
former.</p>

<p>We are naturally led to inquire, Whence these two
movements in opposite directions? That mankind
should either lose ground or gain it, in morality as
a whole, is far less startling at first sight, than that,
at one and the same time, with respect to one great
portion of the moral law there should be progress, and
with respect to another, retrogression.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>
<p>In reality, however, this was the condition of man:
retrogression as to his spiritual life, but advance and
development, up to a certain point, with regard to the
intellectual and the social career. Sins of the flesh
lay chiefly between God and the individual conscience:
the social results did not palpably and immediately
reach beyond the persons immediately concerned. But
crimes of violence struck directly at the fabric of
society by destroying security of person and property;
and robbed mankind, especially the ruling part of
mankind, of the immense advantages and enjoyments
which they reaped from civilized life. Thus, the moral
sense was quick, and even grew quicker with the lapse
of time, when it was fed and prompted by such motives
of self-interest as lay within its appreciation, like
those which the desire to enjoy the commodities of
life supplied. But it languished and all but died,
when its business was to maintain those virtues which
involve severe self-denial, and of which the reward
never can be fully appreciated except by those who are
so favoured as to practise them in the highest degree.</p>

<p>Nor must we overlook some special bearings of the
institution of slavery upon this question. As it grew
and was consolidated, it of course entailed an increased
necessity for laws to defend life and goods against
violence. But as regarded the other class of offences,
its influence was all in the sense of more and more
relaxation. For beauty and defencelessness, when they
were combined in slaves, at once wrought up attraction
to the uttermost, and removed all obstacles to
enjoyment. While at the same time the partial indulgence,
which at all periods has commonly attended
such commerce between slaves and their masters, operated
as a safety valve to let off the political dangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
of that system: so that, on the one hand, slavery was a
feeder to lust, and, on the other, lust was a buttress to
slavery.</p>

<p>That it was not on moral grounds that in the later
times of Greece life and property were better defended
than in the former, we may partly judge from finding
that, though it is in the nature of all society that a
nation should rather incline to gild the days of its forefathers
with ornaments beyond the truth, the later
Greek traditions crammed the heroic age with a mass
of crimes of which Homer knows nothing. He sets
Minos and Rhadamanthus before us as characters positively
good: Thyestes and others are at worst neutral
in character: but all these, according to the later tradition,
were either accessory to, or contaminated with, the
most horrible enormities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Notes in the Poems of commencing decline.</i></div>

<p>It seems, indeed, as if Homer had himself lived to
note the signs of moral degeneracy. In part, we may
perhaps say, it is inseparably associated with that deterioration
in the character and idea of government,
which begins to be traceable in the Odyssey. But in
that poem he has given us another indication of it, unlike
any thing in the Iliad, where he never contrasts
the present unfavourably with the past, except as to
mere corporal strength. For he makes Minerva as
Mentor deliver to Telemachus the sentiment, that
among sons a small number only are equal to their
fathers<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>, a very few indeed excelling them, but the
greater part falling short of them. In later times, we
have come to associate threnodies of this kind with
the notion that they are complaints of course, formulæ
taken up and reiterated successively from generation to
generation. It may or may not be just thus to view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
them: but whether it be just or not for later times, I
think that we ought not so to limit the force of the
idea when it meets us in the age of Homer: the world
was then young, and human society had not so learned
its ‘ancient saws or modern instances,’ as to separate
them from the truths of experience and of observation.
The greatest ornament of the poems of Hesiod, the series
of the Ages declining from gold to iron, probably
expresses the actual state of the facts, as it seems to
move on the same line with the narrative of the early
Scriptures: and Homer’s lamentation on degeneracy in
all likelihood may belong to a real portion of the same
descending process.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><a id="SECT_IX"></a>SECT. IX.<br />

<i>Woman in the Homeric age.</i></h2></div>

<p>No view of a peculiar civilization can on its ethical
side be satisfactory, unless it include a distinct consideration
of the place held in it by woman. And, besides,
the position of the Greek woman of the heroic
age is in itself so remarkable, as even on special
grounds to require separate and detailed notice. It is
likewise so elevated, both absolutely and in comparison
with what it became in the historic ages of Greece and
Rome amidst their elaborate civilization, as to form in
itself a sufficient confutation of the theories of those
writers who can see in the history of mankind only the
development of a law of continual progress from intellectual
darkness into light, and from moral degradation
up to virtue.</p>

<p>The idea and place of woman have been slowly and
laboriously elevated by the Gospel: and their full development
has constituted the purest and most perfect
protest, that the world has ever seen, against the sovereignty
of force. For it is not alone against merely
physical, but also against merely intellectual strength,
that this protest has been lodged. To the very highest
range of intellectual strength known among the
children of Adam, woman seems never to have ascended,
but in every or almost every case to have fallen some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>what
short of it. But when we look to the virtues, it
seems probable both that her average is higher, and
that she also attains in the highest instances to loftier
summits. Certainly there is no proof here of her inferiority
to man. Now it is nowhere written in Holy
Scripture that God is knowledge, or that God is power;
while it is written that God is love: words which appear
to set forth love as the central essence, and all besides
as attributes. Woman then holds of God, and finds her
own principal development in that which is most God-like.
Thus, therefore, when Christianity wrought out
for woman, not a social identity, but a social equality,
not a rivalry with the function of man, but an elevation
in her own function reaching as high as his, it made
the world and human life in this respect also a true
image of the Godhead.</p>

<p>Within the pale of that civilization which has grown
up under the combined influence of the Christian religion
as paramount, and of what may be called the
Teutonic manners as secondary, we find the idea of
woman and her social position raised to a point even
higher than in the poems of Homer. But it would be
hard to discover any period of history or country of the
world, not being Christian, in which they stood so high
as with the Greeks of the heroic age.</p>

<p>There are various heads under which we may inquire
into the subject before us.</p>

<p>One is the law of marriage in the heroic age, and the
state of the specific relation between the sexes.</p>

<p>A second is the employments assigned to women;
how high did they reach, and how low did they descend?</p>

<p>A third is the social footing on which they stood, as
tested by manners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>A fourth is the general outline of the woman’s character,
as it is to be estimated from the varied specimens
which Homer has set before us.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Law and custom of marriage.</i></div>

<p>Firstly; a main criterion of the general condition of
woman in a given state of society is to be found in the
view which it may exhibit of the great institution of
marriage. In proportion as that institution is purified
and elevated by just restraint, the condition of woman
is honourable, free, and happy. In proportion as it is
relaxed, in accommodation to human infirmity or appetite,
the condition of woman is degraded and servile;
for where desire is the law, strength is its appropriate
and only sanction, and the cause of the weaker fails.
Just as a strict and efficient police is most important
to the unprotected, so a strict law of marriage is most
for the interest of the woman.</p>

<p>The general position of womankind in the Homeric
age is high on both sides of the Archipelago; but, as respects
marriage, its chiefest pillar, it is perceptibly even
higher among the Greeks than among the Trojans.
Among the multitude of cases, that either directly or
incidentally come before us in the poems, there is nothing
that at all resembles the Asiatic household of
Priam, or that seems to favour polygamy. Nor have we
any instance where a wife is divorced or taken away from
her husband, and then made the wife of another man
during his lifetime. The froward Suitors, who urge Penelope
to choose a new husband from among them, do it
upon the plea that Ulysses must be dead, and that there
is no hope of his return: a plea not irrational, if we presume
that the real term of his absence came to even
half the number of years which Homer has assigned to
it. The ancient law of England, while it repudiated
the principle of divorce, recognised the presumption of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
the husband’s death, when brought near to certainty
by a long term of absence, as equivalent to death itself
for the purpose of exempting the wife from civil penalty
in case of her marriage. Ægisthus, again, finds it extremely
difficult to corrupt Clytemnestra: and his success
in inducing her to marry him entails, as if a matter
of course, the murder of her former husband. The
crime is mentioned by Jupiter, in the Olympian Court,
as consisting of the two parts, of which he by no
means specifies the latter as the more atrocious<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">(1) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γῆμ’ ἄλοχον μνηστὴν</span>, (2) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸν δ’ ἔκτανε νοστήσαντα</span>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The law of marriage differs from most other human
laws in a very important particular. It is their excellence
to impose the <i>minimum</i> of restraint, which will
satisfy the absolute wants of society: but the aim and
the criterion of a good law of marriage is to impose
the <i>maximum</i> of restraint that human nature can be
induced <i>bonâ fide</i> to accept. Doubtless there is here
also a conceivable excess: but it would be and has been
indicated by the general withholding of submission, or
evasion of obedience. Up to that point, the restrictions
of the marriage law are not evils to be endured for the
sake of a greater good, but are good in themselves.</p>

<p>In order that this great institution may thoroughly
fulfil its ends, it is especially requisite,</p>

<p>1. That it should not be contracted between more
than one man and one woman.</p>

<p>2. That it should on both sides be, in the main and
as a general rule, deliberate and spontaneous.</p>

<p>3. That the contract, once made, should not be dissolved.</p>

<p>And closely allied to these there is yet a fourth
negative:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>
<p>4. That nuptials should not be contracted between
persons who stand within certain near degrees of relationship.</p>

<p>5. It is always requisite that this engagement should
exclude not only the possibility of marriage for either
partner with a third person, but also any other fleshly
connection without marriage.</p>

<p>Of these propositions, the first, third, and fourth,
are heads of restraint on marriage. Every one of the
three was acknowledged by the Greeks of the heroic
age.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Marriage always single.</i></div>

<p>The rule of conjugal fidelity was admitted, though
not wholly without relaxation, to be as applicable to
men as to their wives. This, and all the other restrictions,
were applied to women with undeviating strictness.</p>

<p>1. As regards the first, it is plain, from a mass of
evidence so large as to amount, in spite of its being
negative, to demonstration, that the uniform practice of
the Greeks required the marriage union to be single.
This, however, of itself, is saying little; but it imports
much besides what is on the surface: it implies, that,
with due allowances, the spirit of the marriage contract
is a spirit of equity and of well adjusted rights,
as between those who enter into it.</p>

<p>2. This relation was also conceived by the Greeks in
a spirit of freedom.</p>

<p>It held a central place in life thoroughly European,
as opposed to the Oriental ideas. Nay, it approximated
very much to the ideas prevailing in our own country as
well as age. We do not find in the poems any instance
of a marriage enforced against the will of a young
maiden, or contracted when she was of years too tender
to exercise a judgment. Nausicaa fears that if she is
seen with Ulysses, censorious tongues will immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
put it about that she is going to be married to him.
They will say, ‘Who is this tall and handsome stranger
with Nausicaa?’<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> Surely she is going to become his
bride. Truly she has picked up some gallant from afar,
who has strayed from his ship: or some god has come
down to wed her. Better it were if she found a husband
from abroad, since, forsooth, she looks down upon her
Phæacian suitors, though they are many and noble.
Then continues this model of maidens; ‘Thus I shall
come into disgrace; and indeed I myself should be indignant
with any one who should so act, and who, against
the will of her parents, frequented the company of men
before being publicly married.’ In this remarkable
passage we have such an exhibition of woman’s freedom,
as scarcely any age has exceeded. For it clearly shows
that the marriage of a damsel was her own affair, and
that, subject to a due regard freely rendered to authority
and opinion, she had, when of due age, a main
share in determining it. That is to say, to the extent
of choosing a mate among the competitors. The expression
of giving away or promising a daughter, by
parents, is often used<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>, but we perceive the limits of
its meaning from the passage just quoted. The more
so, because similar expressions as to the proceedings of
parents are applied in Homer to the marriages of sons<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>.
I do not suppose it would have been open to any maiden
to remain single. That all should marry, that there
should be no class living in celibacy, was a kind of law
for society in its infant state, even as now it may be said
to be almost a law for the most numerous classes of
society. Above all I suppose it to be clear that a
marriageable widow could not ordinarily remain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
widowhood. No reproach arises to Helen, on account
of the renewal of her irregular union with Deiphobus;
and when Penelope, or others in her behalf, contemplate
the death of Ulysses, and her consequent release
from the marriage state, that change is always treated
as the immediate preface to another crisis, namely, the
choice of a second husband.</p>

<p>Although social intercourse with man might not, as
Nausicaa says, be sought by damsels, it might innocently
come on occasions such as those afforded by public
festivities, or by an ordinary calling<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Freedom of the woman.</i></div>

<p>But again, the persecution of Penelope by the
Suitors bears emphatic testimony to the freedom of
woman within the limits I have described. The utmost
of their aim is to coerce her into marrying some one;
even as their sin lies in bringing this pressure to bear
upon her before the death of Ulysses has been ascertained.
On the other hand, the pressure is a moral one:
her violent removal is never thought of; and the absolute
silence of the poem on the subject proves that
it would have been at variance with the prevailing
manners, had any cabal been formed, in order even to
constrain her choice towards a particular person. The
very presents, by which the profligate Suitors endeavoured
to ingratiate themselves with the women of the
household of Ulysses, speak favourably of the free condition
of the sex, and seem to show, that it descended
even into lower stations.</p>

<p>For the Greek in the heroic age, marriage was the
pivot of life. It took place in the bloom of age:
hence<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> the beautiful expression, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θαλερὸς γάμος</span>, Od. vi.
66, xx. 74. It even marks of itself the age of persons;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Alcinous has five sons, three <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠΐθεοι</span>, and two <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀπυίοντες</span>,
(Od. vi. 63): three youths or bachelors, and two married.</p>

<p>Presents were usually brought by the bridegroom,
and dowries sometimes given with the bride. Where
the two concurred, the presents may have been either
in the nature of compliments, or intended to meet the
expense of the wedding festivities. The absence of the
former, and the occurrence of the latter, seem each to
be more or less in the nature of an exception. With
a wife returning to her parents, the dowry returned
also<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>. On the other hand, to judge from the story of
Vulcan and Venus, wherever adultery was committed,
the guilty man was bound to pay a fine<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>. The poems
give us several instances where personal gifts and energy
served instead of wealth, as recommendations in suing
for a wife<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>. The drawing of the Bow affords a conspicuous
example of the prevailing ideas.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, then, in all that related to forming
engagements by marriage, there seems to have been
preserved a large regard to the freedom and dignity of
woman<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>. War was doubtless in this respect her great
enemy; she then became the prey of the strongest, and
it is probable that this may have been the most powerful
instrument in promoting the extensive introduction
of concubinage into Greece.</p>

<p>With respect to the ceremonial of marriage, and
the nature of its formal engagement, the Homeric
poems furnish us with scanty evidence. There is no
mention, in fact, of any promise or vow attending it.
The expression <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δαινύναι γάμον</span>, in Od. iv. 3, seems to
contain all that would be included by us when we
speak of celebrating marriage. Not that it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
mere banquet that created the conjugal relation: it
was doubtless the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφάδιος γάμος</span>, the solemn public
acknowledgment, to which relatives and friends, and, in
such a case as that of Hermione, the public or people of
the state, thus became witnesses. This subject will be
further considered in connection with the case of Briseis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Perpetuity of the tie of marriage.</i></div>

<p>3. If the mode of entry into the obligations of married
life was as simple and indeterminate as we have
supposed, such a want of formalities greatly enhances
the strength of the testimony borne by the facts of the
heroic age to what may be called the natural perpetuity
of the marriage contract.</p>

<p>It is a very remarkable circumstance, that, of the two
great poems of Homer, each should in its own way
bear emphatic testimony to this great, and, for all
countries that can bear it, this most precious law.</p>

<p>Neither poem presents us with any case of a divorced
wife; of a couple between whom the marriage tie,
after having once been duly formed, had ceased to
subsist. And each poem in its own way raises this
negative evidence to a form of the greatest cogency,
from its happening to present the very circumstances
under which, if under any, the dissolution of the bond
would have been acknowledged.</p>

<p>In the Iliad, the wife of Menelaus, his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κουριδίη ἄλοχος</span>,
has been living for many years in <i>de facto</i> adultery
with Paris. The line between marriage on the one
hand, and continued cohabitation together with public
recognition on the other, being faintly drawn, Helen is
familiarly known in Troy as the wife of Paris; so she
is called by the Poet, and so she calls herself<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>. Menelaus,
too, is described as her former husband<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>. Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
this was a mere acquiescence in a certain state of facts,
or the regular result of more relaxed usages respecting
marriage in Troy, may be doubtful. But it is clear that
the view of the Greeks was directly opposite. They
never speak of Paris as the husband of Helen. In their
estimation, all the rights of Menelaus remained entire;
and, as we shall see, it appears that, even while the
possession of them was withheld from him, he acknowledged
the reciprocal obligations. Nay, Hector himself
seems to describe Helen as still the wife of Menelaus;
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γνοίης χ’ οἵου φωτὸς ἔχεις θαλερὴν παράκοιτιν</span><a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>.
The war was (so to speak) juridically founded on the
fact, that the lawful marriage was not dissolved by
adultery, even with the addition of all that followed:
that the relation of Helen to her ancient husband was
unchanged. Accordingly, Agamemnon recollects with
pain, that if his brother should die, he will no longer
be in a condition to demand her restoration, and to
enforce it by arms, for his soldiers will forthwith return
home<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>.</p>

<p>The result is in full conformity with this view.
When the war ends, Helen resumes her place as a
matter of course in the house of Menelaus. She bears
it with unconstrained and perfect dignity; and her
relations to her husband carry no mark of the woful
interval, except that its traces indelibly remain in her
own penitential shame.</p>

<p>It is plain that the Greeks heartily detested the
crime of adultery: for one of the three great chapters
of accusation against the Suitors is, that they wooed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
the wife of Ulysses in his lifetime<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>. But it is not less
plain that they knew nothing of the idea, that by that
crime it was placed in the power of any person to obtain
or to confer a release from the obligations of marriage.</p>

<p>Next to adultery, desertion or prolonged absence
has afforded the most favoured plea for the destruction,
so far as human law can destroy it, of the marriage
bond. And indeed it is hardly possible to push the
opposite doctrine to its extreme, and to say that no
married person may remarry, except with demonstrative
evidence of the death of the original husband or
wife respectively. Probably, however, no period of the
world has exhibited a more stringent application of the
doctrine of indissolubility to the case of desertion, than
that on which the plot of the Odyssey is founded;
where, after an absence of the husband prolonged to
the twentieth year, Penelope still waits his return;
prays that death may relieve her from the dread necessity
of making a new choice; and, thus directed by
her own conscience and right feeling, likewise apprehends
condemnation by the public judgment in the event
of her proceeding to contract a new engagement<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>.</p>

<p>The Heroic age has left no more comely monument,
than its informal, but instinctive, and most emphatic
sense, thus recorded for our benefit, of the sanctity of
marriage, of the closeness of the union it creates, and of
the necessity of perpetuity as an element of its capacity
to attain its chief ends, and to administer a real discipline
to the human character.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Greek ideas of incest.</i></div>

<p>4. A further proof of the elevated estimate of marriage
among the Greeks is afforded by their views, so
far as they can be traced, of the offence termed incest.</p>

<p>The Homeric deities, indeed, were released in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
respect, as in others, from all restraint. Eris, or Enuo<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>,
was both the sister and the concubine of Mars: Juno,
the sister and the wife of Jupiter. Æolus<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>, though
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φίλος ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν</span>, must have been more
than man; because Jupiter had made him warden of
the Winds, which it was his prerogative to confine or
to let loose<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>. And in virtue, I suppose, of belonging to
the class of superior beings, his six daughters were,
without any consciousness of offence, the wives, the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰδοῖαι ἄλοχοι</span>, of his six sons<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>.</p>

<p>In Troy, Helen apparently becomes the wife of two
brothers in succession. We must not overrate the force
of merely negative evidence, but it will be observed
that Homer does not furnish us with any trace of this
usage among the Greeks. The story of Phœnix probably
implies, that the connection of the same woman
with a father and a son was incestuous; for the full
efficacy of the remedy proposed by his mother turns on
the supposition, that there would remain to his father
no alternative but incest after Phœnix had gained his
object, and that such an alternative would at once deter
him from the love of the stranger.</p>

<p>In Scheria, Alcinous is married to Arete, the daughter
of his elder brother Rhexenor<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>. Tyro was the
wife of Cretheus, and was apparently also his niece<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>.
Again, we appear to find in the Iliad an example of
a marriage, by one shade yet less desirable, that of a
man with his aunt. Tydeus, the father of Diomed, was
married to a daughter of Adrastus: and Ægialeia the
wife of Diomed, as she is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀδρηστίνη</span>, was probably
his aunt likewise<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>We have also among the Trojans an example of a
man’s marriage with his aunt. Iphidamas, son of Antenor<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a>,
was brought up in the house of Cisses his maternal
grandfather; and he contracted a marriage with his
mother’s sister just before proceeding to the war.</p>

<p>At the same time, the law of incest is clearly a progressive
one from the infancy of mankind onwards, and
what we have to consider is not so much its precise
extent, as the degree of genuine aversion with which
the violation of it is regarded. Upon this subject there
can be no doubt, when we read the passage in the
Eleventh Odyssey respecting the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέγα ἔργον</span> of Œdipus
and Epicaste, and the fearful consequences which,
though it was done in ignorance, it entailed upon
them<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>. In principle, then, that restriction of the field
of choice, which adds so greatly to the intimacy and
firmness of the marriage tie, was fully recognised in
Greece.</p>

<p>Neither do we want traces in Homer of that remarkable
effect of the unifying power of marriage,
which confers upon each partner in the union an equal
and common relation to the family of the other, by a
convention which has so much of the moral strength of
fact. The most remarkable of all the indications upon
this subject in the poems is that, which relates to the future
life of Menelaus. He is said to be elected to the
honour of a place in the region of Elysium after this life,
not in virtue of his own merits, but as being, through
his marriage with Helen, the son-in-law of Jupiter.</p>

<p>The recognition of relationships through the wife or
husband to the husband or wife respectively, and the
existence of names to describe them, is a sign of the
completeness of the union effected by the marriage tie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
That these terms were not merely formal and ceremonious,
we may judge from the speech of Alcinous:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἦ τίς τοι καὶ πηὸς ἀπέφθιτο Ἰλιόθι πρὸ</div>
       <div class="verse">ἐσθλὸς ἐὼν, γαμβρὸς ἢ πενθερὸς, οἵτε μάλιστα</div>
       <div class="verse">κήδιστοι τελέθουσι, μεθ’ αἷμά τε καὶ γένος αὐτῶν<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now of these words we have the following;</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πηὸς</span>, for any relative by affinity;</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκυρὸς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πενθερὸς</span>, father-in-law;</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκυρὴ</span>, mother-in-law;</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δαὴρ</span>, brother-in-law;</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γαλοὼς</span>, sister-in-law;</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γαμβρὸς</span>, son-in-law;</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νυὸς</span>, daughter-in-law;</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μητρυίη</span>, stepmother; or the lawful wife, in relation
to a spurious son. There is but one real example,
Eeribœa, of a stepmother in Homer (Il. v. 389).</p>

<p>And, lastly, we have <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰνατεὶρ</span>, husband’s sister-in-law,
a relationship not expressed by any word in the
English and many other languages. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰνατέρες</span> are
always separate from the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γαλόῳ</span>.</p>

<p>The formation of this large circle of relationships
by affinity is the correlative to a well-defined strictness
in the marriage law. For these relationships would mean
nothing, but would simply betoken and even breed
confusion, unless marriage were perpetual and incest
eschewed.</p>

<p>Friedreich<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> truly observes, that the law of incest, instead
of being tightened, was relaxed at a later period
in Greece; a very decided mark of moral retrogression,
which cannot be cancelled by all the splendours of her
history.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fidelity in married life.</i></div>

<p>5. We come now to the remaining question; how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
was this great obligation practically observed in the
Greece of the heroic age?</p>

<p>Part, at least, of the answer is easy to give. By
women it was observed admirably. Except only in the
case of Anteia, two generations old, there is no instance
in Homer of a woman who seeks the breach of it. The
forcible or half forcible seduction<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>, and progressive contamination,
of a part of the unmarried women who belong
to the household of Ulysses, is one of the three great
crimes which draw down from Heaven such fearful vengeance
upon the Suitors. Of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παλλακὶς</span>, we hear but
twice in the poems; nor can we say that this word meant
more than a concubine<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>. Among the Greek chieftains,
cases of homicide are more frequent than those of
bastardy. And when such instances are mentioned, it is
not in the hardened manner of later times.</p>

<p>It is something at least that, in such matters, a nation
should be alive to shame. We have various signs that
this was so in Greece. One of them is the tender expression<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">παρθένος αἰδοίη, ὑπερώϊον εἰσαναβᾶσα.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It must be remembered, when we touch upon these
morbid parts in human life and nature, that the society
of that period did not avail itself of the expedient of
the professional corruption of a part of womankind in
order to relieve the virtue of the residue from assault.</p>

<p>Among the Greek chieftains and their families,
Polydore, a sister of Achilles, had a spurious son<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>.
Nestor<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> sprang from a father of spurious birth. Each
Ajax had a spurious brother. Only Menelaus of all the
chiefs is mentioned as having himself had an illegitimate
son. This son, who has the touching name of Mega<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>penthes,
was born to him by a slave, evidently after
the rape of Helen; he was apparently recognised in
part; his marriage was celebrated at the same time
with that of his legitimate sister Hermione, but it was
contracted with a person of lower station. He was <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τηλύγετος</span>,
the last as well as the first; though Helen, owing,
as the Poet intimates, to a divine decree, had no more
children, with whom to console her husband, after her
return from the abduction.</p>


<p>The superior rank conferred by lawful birth is in
every case strongly marked; and this perhaps is the
reason why we never find the succession to sovereignty
in Greece disturbed by illegitimate offspring.</p>

<p>The great majority of illegitimate births in Homer
are those ascribed to the paternity of deities. It is probable
that this extraction may be pleaded to cover
sometimes marriages which were conceived to be beneath
the station of the woman; sometimes instances like
that of Astyoche<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>, when war had both excited passion,
and provided opportunities and victims for its gratification<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>.
Setting these cases aside, the cases of illegitimacy
in heroic Greece appear to be rare.</p>

<p>At the same time, instances are found<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> in which a
spurious child (only, however, I think in the case of a
son) is brought up in a manner approaching to that of
the legitimate offspring: and a certain relationship is
acknowledged to exist, for the wife is said to be <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μητρυίη</span>,
or step-mother, to the illegitimate son. In the case
of Pedæus, it was Theano, Antenor’s wife, who herself
educated the bastard: but it is plain that in Troas concubinage
was far more fully recognised, than in Greece.</p>

<p>Agamemnon in the First Iliad, as we have seen,
when announcing his attention to make Chryseis a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
partner of his bed, by no means treats this concubinage
as being what it would have been with Priam, a matter
of course and requiring no apology, but founds it upon
his preferring her to his wife Clytemnestra<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a>.</p>

<p>In the camp before the walls of Troy it certainly
appears as if by the use of the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γέρας</span>, prize, Homer
might, as it is commonly assumed, mean to indicate,
for most of the principal chiefs, that they had captives
taken in war for concubines. But the point is far from
clear; and at any rate Menelaus, as is observed by
Athenæus, forms an exception<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>. This circumstance affords
rather a marked proof of Greek ideas with respect
to the durability of the marriage tie; for that author
is probably right in ascribing it to his being, as it were,
in the presence of his wife Helen. This concubinage,
however, appears to have been single in each case where
it prevailed; or, if it was otherwise, Homer has at least
deemed the circumstance unfit to be recorded. There
is no sign that the seven Lesbian damsels of Il. ix. 128
were concubines.</p>

<p>Achilles, after the removal of Briseis, had Diomede<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a>
for the companion of his couch. But Briseis appears
to have had his attachment in a peculiar degree. He
calls her his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλοχον θυμάρεα</span><a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a>. It is said that the word
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλοχος</span> may mean a concubine<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>. I do not find any
passage in Homer, except this of Il. ix., where it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
not with the most obvious propriety be translated ‘wife.’
It has its highest force, no doubt, in such expressions as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μνηστὴ ἄλοχος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κουριδίη ἄλοχος</span>: even as we say intensively
‘wedded wife.’ But the term is the standing
phrase for wife, as much as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέκνα</span> for children; and it is
impossible, consistently with what we see of the usages
of marriage among the Greeks, to suppose that the
same term was alike applicable to wives and concubines.
Nor is it necessary to draw such a conclusion
from this passage. We might be tempted to suppose,
that Achilles here puts a strain as it were upon the use of
the word, and for the moment calls Briseis his wife,
in order to prepare the way for the tremendous and
piercing sarcasm which immediately follows<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἦ μοῦνοι φιλέουσ’ ἀλόχους μερόπων ἀνθρώπων</div>
       <div class="verse">Ἀτρεῖδαι;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But we may, I think, more justly, and without any resort
to figure, observe, that the whole argument of this passage
turns upon and requires us to suppose his having
treated Briseis as he would have treated a wife. So
likewise his declaration, that every good man loves and
cares for his wife, becomes insipid, and the whole comparison
with the case of Menelaus senseless, unless we
are to give the force of wife to the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλοχος</span>.</p>

<p>Probably the explanation may be, that she was designated
for marriage with him; for in the Nineteenth
Book, where she utters a lamentation over Patroclus,
she declares how that chief kindly encouraged her to
bear up in her widowhood and captivity, promising
that she should be the wife of Achilles, and that the
banquets, which, with their attendant sacrifices, seem
to have constituted for the Homeric Greeks the cere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>monial
of marriage, should be celebrated on their return
to Phthia<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>. I should therefore suppose that we
might with strict justice render <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄλοχος</span>, in Il. ix. 336,
‘my bride;’ always remembering that we are dealing
with a relation that was not governed by rules, and
that might virtually inure by usage only.</p>

<p>The subsequent passage<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>, in which the hero speaks
of marrying some damsel of Hellas or Phthia, is quite
consistent with this construction, for, as it is plain that
no actual marriage had been concluded between them,
his relation to Briseis terminated with her removal <i>de
facto</i>. The same passage, as well as the custom of
Greece, makes it reasonable to understand that the
mother of Neoptolemus, whoever she may have been,
was now dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Mode of contracting marriage.</i></div>

<p>Indeed it is to be remembered all along, that we
are speaking of a state, rather than an act. We know
nothing of a ceremonial of Homeric marriage beyond
the exchange of gifts and the celebration of festivities
in connection with the domicile, neither of which could
ordinarily have place in the case of a captive while
continuing such. She would grow into a wife in virtue
of intention on the part of her lord, confirmed by
habit, and sealed by a full recognition when the circumstances,
that would alone admit of it, should have
arrived.</p>

<p>The concubinage of the Greek chiefs, practised as it
was during a long absence from home, bears an entirely
different domestic and social character from that of
Priam. It clearly constitutes, especially if the connections
were single, the mildest and least licentious
of all the forms in which the obligations of the marriage
tie could be relaxed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span></p>

<p>The presence of a concubine within the precinct of
the family seems to have been differently viewed by the
Greeks; for here, and here only, do we find the disparaging
word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παλλακὶς</span> (whence the Latin <i>pellex</i>) applied
to a person in that position. The two cases of it are
as follows. In one of them Ulysses feigns a story of
his having been a son of the Cretan Castor, born of
a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παλλακὶς</span>, but (which he mentions as a departure from
the general rule) regarded by his father as much as
were his legitimate children<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>. The other is the instance
of Phœnix in the Ninth Iliad. Amyntor his father had
an intended or actual concubine; and, bestowing his
affections on her, slighted the mother of his child. She,
in resentment or self-defence, entreated her son Phœnix
to cross or anticipate his father<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>, and win the woman
to his own embraces<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>. He complied; and thus drew
down upon himself the dire wrath and curses of his
father, which kindled his own anger in return; but he
restrained himself from the act of parricide, and became
a fugitive instead. This legend is somewhat
obscure; but it appears to indicate plainly that concubinage
was not a recognised institution among the
Greeks, as it seems to have been among the Trojans.</p>

<p>So again, when Laertes had purchased Euryclea<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>,
we are told that he never attempted to make her his
concubine, anticipating the resentment of his wife. It is
plain, therefore, that this would have been an admitted
offence on his part; and accordingly, that concubinage
was contrary to the ideas of Greece respecting conjugal
obligation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dignity of conjugal manners.</i></div>

<p>Within the precinct of the Greek marriages, which
was secured and fenced in the manner we have seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
there prevailed that tenderness, freedom, and elevation
of manners, which was the natural offspring of a system
in the main so sound and strict. The general tone of
the relations of husband and wife in the Homeric
poems is thoroughly natural; it is full of dignity and
warmth; a sort of noble deference, reciprocally adjusted
according to the position of the giver and the
receiver, prevails on either side. I will venture to add,
it is full also of delicacy, though we must be content
to distinguish, in considering this point, between what
is essential and what is conventional, and must make
some allowance for the directness and simplicity of expression
that characterized an artless age<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>.</p>

<p>With this delicacy was combined a not less remarkable
freedom in the Greek manners with respect to
women. We find Penelope appearing in her palace at
will, on all ordinary occasions, before the Suitors; although,
on the other hand, no woman would be present
where any thing like license was to be exhibited, as
we may judge from the case of the lay of Demodocus in
the Eighth Odyssey. The general freedom of woman is
however most fully exhibited in the case of Nausicaa.
She goes forth into the country with her maidens unattended.
When Ulysses appears there is no fear of
him as a man, or even as a stranger, but only from his
condition at the moment. This difficulty she surmounts
with a dignity which she could not have possessed by
virtue of her personal character only, nor except in a
case where great liberty was habitually and traditionally
enjoyed by women.</p>

<p>Her arrangement of the manner in which he is to
enter the city apart from her, and her regard in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
matter to opinion, both rest upon the same presumption
of her freedom from petty control, as does her playful
demand upon Ulysses for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζωάγρια</span>, or salvage.</p>

<p>Again, how remarkable it is that Alcinous, far from
being surprised that his maiden daughter should have
entered into conversation with a stranger, is actually on
the point of finding fault with her for not having shown
a greater forwardness, and brought him home in her
own company: a reproach, from which Ulysses saves
her by his intercession<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Social position of the wife.</i></div>

<p>It is not only from this or that particular, but it is
from the whole tone of the intercourse maintained between
men and women, that we are really to judge
what is the social position of the latter.</p>

<p>And this tone it is which supplies such conclusive
evidence with respect to the age of Homer. Achilles
observes, that love and care<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> towards a wife are a matter
of course with every right-minded man. Love and care,
indeed, may be shown to a pet animal. It is not on
the mere words, therefore, that we must rest our conclusions;
but upon the spirit in which they are spoken, and
the whole circle of signs with which they are associated.
It is on the reciprocity of all those sentiments between
man and wife, father and daughter, son and mother,
which are connected with the moral dignity of the
human being. It is on the confidence exchanged between
them, and the loving liberty of advice and exhortation
from the one to the other. The social equality of man
and woman is of course to be understood with reserves,
as is that other equality, which nevertheless indicates
a political truth of the utmost importance, the equality
of all classes in the eye of the law. There are differences
in the nature and constitution of the two great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
divisions of the race, to be met by adaptations of treatment
and of occupation; without such adaptations, the
seeming equality would be partiality alike dangerous and
irrational. But, subject to those reserves, we find in
Homer the fulness of moral and intelligent being alike
consummate, alike acknowledged, on the one side and
on the other. The conversation of Hector and Andromache
in the Sixth Iliad, of Ulysses and Penelope in the
Twenty-third Odyssey, the position of Arete at the
court of Alcinous, and that of Helen in the palace of
Menelaus, all tell one and the same tale. Ulysses, for
example, where he wishes to convey his supplication in
Scheria to the King, does it by falling at the Queen’s
feet: but she does not supplicate her husband: the address
to her seems to have sufficed. And Helen appears,
in the palace of Menelaus, on such a footing relatively
to her husband, as would perfectly befit the present
relations of man and woman. Nay, we may take the
speech of Helen in the Sixth Iliad, addressed to Hector,
where she touches on the character of Paris, as equal
to any of them by way of social indication. What we
there read is not the sagacity or intelligence of the
speaker, but it is the right of the wife (so to call her)
to speak about the character of her husband and its
failings, her acknowledged possession of the standing
ground from which she can so speak, and speak with
firmness, nay, even with an authority of her own.</p>

<p>When we see Briseis, the widow of a prince, sharing
the bed of Achilles, and delivered over as a slave into
the hands of Agamemnon, when we find Hector anticipating
that Andromache might be required to perform
menial offices for a Greek mistress, and Nestor
encouraging the army not to quit Troy until they had
forced the Trojan matrons into their embraces, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
struck with pity and horror. But we must separate
between the danger and suffering which uniformly dogs
the weak in times of violence, most of all, too, after the
sack of a city, and what belongs to the age of Homer
in particular. After this separation has been effected,
there remains nothing which ought to depress our views
of the position of woman in the heroic age. The sons
of Priam, princes of Troy, were sold into captivity by
Achilles as he took them<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>: of course the purchasers
put them to menial employments. Not only so, but
Eumæus, the faithful swineherd and slave of Ulysses,
was by birth royal: his father Ctesios was king of two
wealthy and happy cities<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>. From the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Εὐρυμέδουσα</span>,
it would appear probable that she also, the
chamber-woman of the palace of Alcinous, though a
captive, was of noble birth<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>.</p>

<p>There is not in the whole of the poems an instance
of rude or abusive manners towards woman as such, or
of liberties taken with them in the course of daily life.
If Melantho gets hard words, it is not as a woman, but
for her vice and insolence. The conduct of the Ithacan
Suitors to Penelope, as it is represented in the Odyssey,
affords the strongest evidence of the respect in which
women were held. Her son had been a child: there
was no strong party of adherents to the family; yet the
highflown insolence of the Suitors, demanding that she
should marry again, is kept at bay for years, and never
proceeds to violence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Force of conjugal attachments.</i></div>

<p>We find throughout the poems those signs of the
overpowering force of conjugal attachments which, from
all that has preceded, we might expect. While admitting
the superior beauty of Calypso as an Immortal,
Ulysses frankly owns to her that his heart is pining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
every day for Penelope<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>. It is the highest honour of a
hero to die fighting on behalf of his wife and children.
The continuance of domestic happiness, and the concord
of man and wife, is a blessing so great, that it excites
the envy of the gods, and they interrupt it by
some adverse dispensation<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>. And no wonder; for nothing
has earth to offer better, than when man and
wife dwell together in unity of spirit: their friends
rejoice, their foes repine: the human heart has nothing
more to desire<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>. There is here apparently involved
that great and characteristic idea of the conjugal relation,
that it includes and concentrates in itself all other
loves. And this very idea is expressed by Andromache,
where, after relating the slaughter of her family by
Achilles, she tells Hector, ‘Hector, nay but thou art
for me a father, and a mother, and a brother, as well as
the husband of my youth<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>.’ To which he in the same
spirit of enlarged attachment replies, by saying that
neither the fate of Troy, which he sees approaching, nor
of Hecuba, nor of Priam, nor of his brothers, can move
his soul like the thought, that Andromache will as a
captive weave the web, and bear the pitcher, for some
dame of Messe or of Hypereia<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Woman-characters of Homer.</i></div>

<p>With the pictures which we thus find largely scattered
over the poems, of the relations of woman to
others, the characters which Homer has given us of
woman herself are in thorough harmony. Among his
living characters we do not find the viragos, the termagants,
the incarnate fiends, of the later legends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
Nay, the woman of Homer never dreams of using violence,
even as a protection against wrong. It must be
admitted, that he does not even present to us the
heroine in any more pronounced form, than that of the
moral endurance of Penelope. The heroine proper, the
Joan of Arc, is certainly a noble creation: but yet one
perhaps implying a state of things more abnormal, than
that which had been reached by the Greeks of the
Homeric age. The pictures of women, which Homer
presents to us, are perfect pictures; but they are
pictures simply of mothers, matrons, sisters, daughters,
maidens, wives. The description which the Poet has
given us of the violence and depravity of Clytemnestra,
is the genuine counterpart of his high conception of
the nature of woman<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ὣς οὐκ αἰνότερον καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο γυναικὸς,</div>
       <div class="verse">ἥτις δὴ τοιαῦτα μετὰ φρεσὶν ἔργα βάληται.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For, in proportion as that nature is elevated and
pure, does it become more shameful and degraded
when, by a total suppression of its better instincts, it
has been given over to wickedness.</p>

<p>Of the minor infirmities of our nature, as well as
of its grosser faults, the women of Homer betray much
less than the men. Nowhere has he introduced into
a prominent position the character of a vicious woman.
The only instance of the kind is among a portion of the
female attendants in the palace of Ulysses, where, out
of fifty, no more than twelve were at last the willing
tools, having at first<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> been the reluctant victims, of the
lust of the proud and rapacious band of Suitors.
Clytemnestra, indeed, appears as a lofty criminal in the
perspective of the poem, but her wickedness, too, is
wholly derivative. Ægisthus corrupts her by a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
course of effort, for, as Homer informs us, she had
been a right-minded person; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φρεσὶ γὰρ κέχρητ’ ἀγαθῇσι</span><a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>.
On the one side we have only to place her and the
saucy slut Melantho; on the other, we have Andromache,
Hecuba, and Briseis in the Iliad; in the
Odyssey, Penelope and Euryclea, Arete and Nausicaa;
the slightly drawn figures, such as that of the mother
of Ulysses in the Eleventh Odyssey, are in the same
spirit as the more full delineations. There is not
a single case in the poems to qualify the observation,
first, that the woman of Homer is profoundly feminine:
secondly, that she is commonly the prop of virtue,
rarely the instrument, and (in this reversing the order
of the first temptation) never the source, of corruption.</p>

<p>In company with all that we have seen, we likewise
find that the limits of the position of woman are carefully
marked, and that she fully comprehends them.
There is nowhere throughout the poems a single effort
at self-assertion: the ground that she holds, she holds
without dispute. If at any point a stumblingblock could
be likely to be found, it would be between a mother
just parting with her authority, and a son newly come of
age. Yet Penelope and Telemachus never clash, and thoroughly
understand one another. Again, the Homeric
man, even the Homeric good man, is sometimes the subject
of hasty, vehement, and tumultuous passions; the
woman never. She finds her power in gentleness; she
rules with a silken thread; she is eminent for the uniformity
of her self-command, and for the observance of
measure in all the relations of life. The misogynism
which marked Euripides and other later writers has, and
could have, no place in Homer: the moral standard of
his women is higher than that of his men; their office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
which they perform without fault, is to love and to minister,
and their reward to lean on those whom they serve.</p>

<p>The lower aspect of the relation between the two
sexes is in the poems wholly secondary. All that tends
to sensualize it is commonly repelled or hidden, and,
when brought into mention at all, is yet carefully and
anxiously depressed. Even the cases of exception, which
lie beyond the pale of marriage, are kept in a certain
analogy with it, and are as far as possible removed from
the promiscuous and brutal indulgence, which marked
the later Pagan ages, including those of the greatest
pride and splendour, and which still so deeply taints
the societies of Christendom.</p>

<p>We may find, if it be needed, some further evidence
of the high position of woman upon earth in the relation
subsisting between the Homeric gods and goddesses
respectively. For that relation approaches as nearly as
may be to equality in force and intelligence, while in
purity the latter are on the whole superior. After
Jupiter, the deities most elevated in Homer are, Juno
and Minerva, Neptune and Apollo; and of all these, I
think, we must consider Minerva to have stood first
in his estimation. This arrangement could not but harmonize
with, while it also serves to measure, his ideas
of the earthly place and character of woman.</p>

<p>A similar inference is suggested by the tendency of
the Greeks to enshrine many ideas, sometimes great,
and occasionally both great and good, in feminine
impersonations.</p>

<p>We will, lastly, inquire into the employments of
women in the heroic age; both to ascertain how nearly
they could approach to the summits of society, and
also what was their general share in the division of
occupations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Women were admitted to sovereignty.</i></div>

<p>Among nations where war, homicide, and piracy so
extensively prevailed, it is certainly deserving of peculiar
consideration, that we should find any traces of the
exercise of sovereignty by a woman. There are however
three cases in the poems, which in a greater or
less degree serve to imply that it was neither unknown
nor wholly unfamiliar.</p>

<p>1. Andromache states, that her mother was queen in
Hypoplacian Thebes. The word is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασίλευεν</span><a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>. It implies
more than being the mere wife of a king; though,
as it was during the life time of her husband Eetion, we
cannot justly infer from it that there was here any
exercise of independent sovereign power. It is the
only instance in the Iliad, where we have any word,
that has <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλεὺς</span> for its basis, applied to a woman.</p>

<p>2. The common tradition is, that Jason acquired possession
of Lemnos by marriage with Hypsipyle its queen.
This is so far supported by Homer that, while Jason
clearly appears in the poems as a Greek, we notwithstanding
find his son sovereign of Lemnos, without any
indication of a conquest or regular migration, and
Hypsipyle is mentioned as his mother. The simple
fact that the mother, contrary to Homer’s usual practice,
is in this case named as well as the father, raises
a presumption that it is because she had reigned in the
island<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Eleventh Odyssey we are told that Neleus,
the younger of the two illegitimate sons of Tyro, came
to dwell in Pylos, and that he married Chloris, the
youngest daughter of Amphion an Iasid, giving large
presents to obtain her hand<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>. The text proceeds,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἡ δὲ Πύλου βασίλευε, τέκεν δέ οἱ ἀγλαὰ τέκνα.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>This may mean that she became his queen when he was
king of Pylos: or it may mean that he became her
husband when she was already queen there.</p>

<p>The Odyssey discloses to us the manner in which,
under circumstances like those of the Trojan war,
sovereign power would naturally pass into female
hands otherwise than by inheritance.</p>

<p>It would appear that, when Agamemnon set sail for
Troy, he left Clytemnestra in charge of his affairs as
well as of his young son Orestes, only taking the precaution
to provide her with a trustworthy counsellor in
the person of his Bard<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>. As it was by inveigling Clytemnestra
that Ægisthus obtained the sovereign power,
she must evidently have been its depository.</p>

<p>In like manner it would appear, that Penelope was
left in charge of Telemachus by Ulysses when he went
to Troy, and that Mentor was appointed to perform for
her some such friendly office, as that which the Bard
undertook for Clytemnestra. The statement here is,
that Ulysses committed to him authority over his
whole household<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>. But it is plain that Penelope had
the indoor management; since Telemachus speaks of
the mode in which she regulated the reception of
strangers<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a>, and we hear of her rule in other matters<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>.
Here we see openings for the natural formation of the
word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασίλισσα</span>, which seems originally to have meant,
not a king’s wife merely, but a woman in the actual
exercise of royal authority; and which first appears in
the Odyssey.</p>

<p>The ordinary occupation of women of the highest
rank in the poems is undoubtedly to sit engaged, along
with their maidens of the household, in spinning, weav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>ing,
or embroidery. Thus we find it with Helen, Penelope,
and Andromache. But when Hector bids
Andromache retire to these duties, he speaks of them
in contradistinction not to all other duties, but to war,
which, as he says, is the affair of men. Even this rule,
however, was subject to exception. The Bellerophon of
Homer fights with the Amazons<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>; and the part taken
by the goddesses in the Theomachy shows, that the
idea of women-soldiers was not wholly strange to his
mind; as it is in fact to this day, I believe, less attractively
exemplified in the African kingdom of Dahomey.
But manual employments, taken alone, would not
afford a just criterion. The dialogues of the speeches
clearly show that then, as now, the woman was concerned
in all that concerned her husband.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>And to the service of the gods.</i></div>

<p>Next to political supremacy, we may naturally inquire
how far women were qualified for the service of
the gods.</p>

<p>We have various signs, more or less clear, of their
sharing in it. The reference to the Nurses of Dionysus
cannot be wholly without force in this direction. The
abstraction of Alcyone by Apollo has probably a more
positive connection with female ministry. But we are
provided, as far as Troy at least is concerned, with one
clear and conclusive instance. The Sixth Iliad affords
us a glimpse of a female priesthood, and a worship
confined to women, that subsisted among the Trojans.
Helenus, alarmed at the feats of Diomed, urges Hector
to desire Hecuba to collect the aged women for a procession
to the temple of Athene, with a robe for a gift,
and with the promise of a hecatomb (Il. vi. 75&ndash;101).
Hector then acquaints the troops, that he was going
to desire the old counsellors and the matrons of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
city to supplicate the deities, and to promise hecatombs
(iii. 15). There seems to be something of policy
in the way in which he thus generalizes, for the army,
his account of the design: perhaps afraid of the effect
that might be produced by its peculiar character.
When he finds Hecuba, he lays upon her precisely the
injunction that Helenus had recommended. She sends
her female servants to collect the aged women through
the city (286, 7). She leads them to the temple of
Athene in the citadel. They are there received by
Theano, who had been appointed, apparently by the
Trojan public<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a>, priestess to that deity. Theano takes
the robe from Hecuba, and herself offers it and prays.
Her prayer is for the city, and not for the men by name,
but for the wives and infants: and her promise is, <i>we</i> will
sacrifice, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερεύσομεν</span>, twelve, not oxen, but heifers, yearlings,
untouched by the goad (Il. vi. 296&ndash;310). Thus
the feminine element runs apart through the whole.</p>

<p>We have no reason to conclude that this order of
things was exceptional; for though the time was one
of peculiar danger and emergency, the temple, the
worship, and the priesthood stand before us as belonging
to the regular institutions of Troy.</p>

<p>We have no case like that of Theano among the
Greeks. It could, indeed, hardly be expected; as priesthood
had not yet grown to be an Hellenic institution.
Yet, while the direct force of the narrative speaks for
Troy alone, we are justified in giving it a more general
significance, because the Greek woman is apparently
rather before than behind the Trojan one in influence,
and in the substantiveness of her position.</p>

<p>In the Trojan genealogy<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> no notice is taken of
women; nor have we any means of judging whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
they were regarded as capable of succession to the
throne, or what was their political and historical importance.
But among the Greek races this was clearly
great. The large number of women whom Homer has
introduced in the realm of Aides, and the parts assigned
to them, are plain indications of their important share
in the movement of Greek history.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their household employments.</i></div>

<p>The apportionment of the ordinary employments of
women appears to have been managed in general accordance
with the suppositions, towards which all the
foregoing facts would lead us.</p>

<p>We have them indicated in a great variety of passages
of the poems, from among which we may select
two in particular.</p>

<p>The first relates to Circe and her attendant Nymphs;
but we may take it as an exact copy of the arrangements
of a prince’s household.</p>

<p>Circe has four female servants, who are called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δρήστειραι</span>.
The first provides the seats with the proper
coverings; the second prepares and lays the tables;
the third mixes the wine and brings the goblets; the
fourth carries water, and lights the fire to boil it<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>.</p>

<p>The second passage exhibits to us the household of
Ulysses at the break of day, when the in-door and out-door
servants are setting about their morning duties.</p>

<p>There were fifty women servants. Of these twelve
were employed as flour-grinders (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλετρίες</span>); and this
appears to have been the most laborious employment
among all those assigned to women. Eleven of the
twelve have finished their task and retired to rest; the
twelfth remains till the morning at her work, and
curses the Suitors who cause her such fatigue<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p>It is now dawn<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>. Part of the maid-servants are
lighting the fire. The old but active Euryclea is up
betimes, and has<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> the place of housekeeper. She desires
a part of them to set smartly about sweeping the
house, and putting the proper covers on the furniture;
another part are to wipe the tables and the cups; a
third bevy, no fewer than twenty in number, are dispatched
for water<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>.</p>

<p>Meantime the men-servants (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δρηστῆρες</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεράποντες</span>)<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>
of the Suitors have made their appearance, and
they set about preparing logs for the fire. Then come
in from the country the swineherd with his swine, the
goatherd with his goats; and, from over the water, the
cowherd with his cow, and with more goats.</p>

<p>Taking the general evidence of the poems, it stands
thus. Of agricultural operations, we find women sharing
only in the lighter labours of the vintage<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a>; or perhaps
acting as shepherdesses<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a>. The men plough, sow,
reap, tend cattle and live stock generally; they hunt
and they fish; and they carry to the farm the manure
that is accumulated about the house<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a>.</p>

<p>Within doors, the women seem to have the whole
duty in their hands, except the preparation of firewood
and of animal food. The men kill, cut up, dress, and
carve the animals that are to be eaten. The women,
on the other hand, spin, weave, wash the clothes, clean
the house, grind the corn, bake the bread and serve it<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>,
with all the vegetable or mixed food, or what may be
called made dishes<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴδατα πολλά</span>). They also prepare the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
table, and hand the ewer with the basin for washing.
And a portion of them act as immediate attendants to
the mistress of the palace, Andromache, Penelope, or
Helen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Their service about the bath.</i></div>

<p>Thus far all is easy and becoming; but an apparent
difficulty confronts us when we find, that it was the usage
for women to undertake certain duties connected with
the bathing of men. Sometimes this was done by servants;
thus it was managed for Telemachus and Pisistratus
in the palace of Menelaus, and for Ulysses in that of
the Phæacian king. On the other hand, it was sometimes
an office of hospitality rendered by women, and
even by young damsels, of the highest rank, to distinguished
strangers of their own age or otherwise.
Polycaste, the young and fair daughter of Nestor, (as
the text is commonly interpreted,) bathed and anointed
Telemachus, and put on him a cloak and vest<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a>. Helen
herself, when she was living in Troy, performed the like
offices for Ulysses, on the occasion of his mission
thither in the disguise of a beggar<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἀλλ’ ὅτε δή μιν ἐγὼ λόεον καὶ χρῖον ἐλαίῳ,</div>
       <div class="verse">ἀμφὶ δὲ εἵματα ἕσσα....</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And lastly, the goddess Circe discharged the very
same function, with some addition to the description,
on behalf of Ulysses her visitor. For here it is explicitly
stated, that she poured water over his head and
shoulders<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἔς ῥ’ ἀσάμινθον ἕσασα λό’ ἐκ τρίποδος μεγάλοιο,</div>
       <div class="verse">θυμῆρες κεράσασα, κατὰ κρατός τε καὶ ὤμων.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This usage has given occasion, as was perhaps to be
expected, to much criticism<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> upon the immodest habits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
of Homer and his age. Pains have also been taken in
their defence<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a>. And certainly, if there be need of a
defence, Eustathius does not supply one by pleading,
that it was the custom of the time, and that the
Pylian princess doubtless acted by the command of her
father<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a>. What is wanted appears to me not to be defence,
but simply the clearing away of misapprehensions
as to the facts.</p>

<p>It would assuredly be strange, were we to detect
real immodesty among such women of the heroic age
as Homer has described to us; or even among such
men. At a period when the exposure, among men
only, of the person of a man constituted the last extremity
of shameful punishment<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>, and when even in
circumstances of the utmost necessity Ulysses exhibited
so much care to avoid anything of the kind<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a>, it is
almost of itself incredible that habitually, among persons
of the highest rank and character, and without
any necessity at all, such things should take place.
And, as it is not credible, so neither, I think, is it
true.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that there is no case of ablution
thus performed in the Iliad. But this appears to be
only for the same reason, as that which makes the meals
of the camp more simple, than those which were served
in the tranquillity of peace and home.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Explanations of the presumed difficulty.</i></div>

<p>The words commonly employed by Homer in this
matter refer to two separate parts of the operation:
first, the bathing and anointing, then the dressing.
They are commonly for the first <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λούω</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρίω</span>: for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
second <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βάλλω</span>, with the names of the proper vestments
added (Od. iii. 467);</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">ἀμφὶ δέ μιν φᾶρος<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλὸν βάλεν ἠδὲ χιτῶνα</span>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the whole question, in my view, really depends
upon this: whether the verbs used mean the performance
of a particular operation, or the giving to the
person concerned the means of doing it for himself.
Just as by feeding the poor, we mean giving them
wherewithal to feed themselves. This is the suggestion
of Wakefield<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>, and I believe it to be the satisfactory
and conclusive solution of the whole question. We
might be prevailed upon to travel a good way in company
with Heroic simplicity, and yet not quite be able
to reach the point which the opposite interpretation
would require.</p>

<p>I think that the construction, which I have indicated
as the proper one, is conclusively made good, first by
the general rules for the sense of the words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λούω</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λούομαι</span>,
and kindred words in Homer: and secondly, by
the detailed evidence of facts.</p>

<p>When the guests at a feast wash their hands, the
standard expression is in the middle voice, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χερνίψαντο
δ’ ἔπειτα.</span> When Ulysses and Diomed washed in the
sea, the expression is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱδρῶ ἀπενίζοντο</span>: when they afterwards
bathed and anointed themselves, it is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λούσαντο</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λοεσσαμένω</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλειψαμένω</span><a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>. To smear arrows with poison
is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰοὺς χρίεσθαι χαλκήρεας</span><a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>. For the maidens of Nausicaa,
when they bathe and are anointed, we have
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λοεσσάμεναι</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρισάμεναι</span><a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>. In fact the usage is
general.</p>

<p>The case stands rather differently with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βάλλω</span>. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
the active usage is, I believe, the common one. But
there is ample authority for the converse or active use
of the middle voice, which corresponds with the middle
use of the active. As for instance,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">αὐτίκα δ’ ἀμφ’ ὤμοισιν ἐβάλλετο κάμπυλα τόξα<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There can therefore surely be no reason to doubt that
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βάλλειν</span> in this place follows the inclination of the
leading words of the passages, and signifies, that as the
water and the oil, so likewise the fresh clothing to put
on, were given by the damsel for the purpose, but by
no means that the operations, or any of them, were
actually performed by her.</p>

<p>If the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βάλλειν</span> meant ‘to put on,’ there would
be, as Eustathius<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> observes, an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑστερολογία</span>, for the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χίτων</span> was as a matter of course put on before the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φᾶρος</span>.
But if it means ‘to give for the purpose of putting on,’
then there is no solecism in the mode of expression.</p>

<p>We must not, however, pass by the case of Circe in
the Tenth Odyssey, where, as we have seen, it is stated
that the water was actually poured by the Sorceress
over the head and shoulders of Ulysses. It is also true
that the old word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λοέω</span>, equivalent to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λούω</span>, is used there
in the active voice.</p>

<p>Upon this I observe three things:</p>

<p>1. The statement that the water was poured over his
head and shoulders, as he sat in the bath, evidently implies
that what may be called essential decency was
preserved.</p>

<p>2. Even if it were not so, we could not in this point
argue from the manners or morals of a Phœnician
goddess to those of a Greek damsel.</p>

<p>3. The meaning probably of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λοέω</span> is middle, in this
as well as in the other cases: she gave him water to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
wash with, pouring it over his head and shoulders, and
then leaving to him the substance of the operation,
which was not completed by this mere act of affusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Case of Ulysses landed in Scheria.</i></div>

<p>Finally, let us consider the evidence from the case
of Ulysses in Scheria, which appears of itself conclusive.</p>

<p>1. In Od. vii. 296. Ulysses says that Nausicaa (according
to the popular construction of the term) bathed
him: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καὶ λοῦσ’ ἐν ποταμῷ</span>.</p>

<p>2. But from Od. vi. 210, we find that what she did
was not to bathe him, but to give orders to her attendants
that he should be bathed,&mdash;that is, should be provided
with the requisites for bathing. Her words were,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λούσατέ τ’ ἐν ποταμῷ, ὅθ’ ἐπὶ σκέπας ἔστ’ ἀνέμοιο</span>.</p>

<p>3. Upon this they took him to a recess, gave him
clothing and oil, and bid him bathe himself, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἤνωγον δ’
ἄρα μιν λοῦσθαι</span>: upon which he requested them to
stand off, as otherwise he could not proceed: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄντην δ’
οὐκ ἂν ἐγώγε λοέσσομαι</span> (ibid. 218&ndash;22).</p>

<p>It would appear therefore, that the statements of
Homer give no ground whatever for sinister or disparaging
imputation. His pictures do not entirely correspond
with modern ideas: but they may well leave on
our minds the impression that, in the period he described,
if the standard of appearances in this department
was lower, that of positive thought and action
was higher, as well as simpler, than in our own day.</p>

<p>We have now concluded what it seemed needful to
say on the employments of women.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Subsequent declension of the place of woman.</i></div>

<p>It was, however, little likely that a state of things,
such as has been described, should last.</p>

<p>The idea of marriage was in aftertimes greatly
lowered, together with the moral tone in general; and
the very name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γάμος</span>, with its kindred words, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>went
a change of sense, and was made applicable to such
a relation as that established between the Greek
chieftains in the war of Troy and their captives in
cases where they had wives already<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, in the Hecuba of Euripides, as the mother of
Cassandra, she intercedes with Agamemnon to avenge
the murder of her son Polydorus, on the ground that
the youth had become a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κηδεστὴς</span>, or relation by affinity
to Agamemnon, who had a wife already<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">τοῦτον καλῶς δρῶν ὄντα κηδεστὴν σέθεν</div>
       <div class="verse">δράσεις.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And, in the Troades, Cassandra has with Agamemnon
certain <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκότια νυμφευτήρια</span> (258); and again,</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">γαμεῖ βιαίως σκότιον Ἀγαμέμνων λέχος<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Similar language is used in the case of Andromache<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a>.
The ideas of the heroic age would have admitted no
such depravation of marriage.</p>

<p>In truth it would seem not only as if, before Christianity
appeared, notwithstanding the advance of civilization,
the idea and place of woman were below what
they should have been, but actually as if, with respect
to all that was most essential, they sank with the
lapse of time.</p>

<p>The contrast between the views of the marriage state
entertained in the heroic age, and at the period which
we regard as the acmè of the Greek civilization, will,
perhaps, be best conceived by referring to the passage
ascribed to Demosthenes, as it is quoted by Athenæus,
which explains succinctly the several uses of prostitutes,
concubines, and wives, apparently as classes all alike
recognised, and without any note of a moral difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
in their social position and repute respectively. The
first are for pleasure, the second for daily use, the last
for legitimate offspring, and for good housekeeping<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a>.</p>

<p>And yet it continued to be, in the time of Aristotle,
a favourable distinction of Greece as compared with
the barbarians, that the woman was not with them
equivalent to the slave. Throughout their history
they continued to be a nation of monogamists, except
where they became locally tainted with oriental manners<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>.</p>

<p>Again, Aristotle, in the Nicomachean Ethics, taking a
general survey of the relation between man and wife,
describes it as a government indeed, but as analogous
to that natural and perfect form of government which
he terms aristocracy. It is founded on merit and
fitness. The man leaves to the woman all for which
she is best suited, and each kind contributes its particular
gifts to make up the common stock.</p>

<p>There was much, then, of solidity, and permanence
in the ground secured for the Greek woman by the
heroic age. But the philosopher, sagacious and dispassionate
as he is, had still a much less elevated view
of her position than Homer had exhibited.</p>

<p>There may<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>, he says, be in a tragedy a good or bad
woman, a good or a bad slave; there is room for
variety even in these; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καί τοίγε ἴσως τούτων τὸ μὲν
χεῖρον τὸ δὲ ὅλως φαῦλόν ἐστι</span>. No such classification,
no such comparison, could have found place in the
heroic age. Yet more remarkable is the little postscript
assigned to the widows of the dead in the funeral
oration assigned by Thucydides to Pericles: “If I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
also say a few words, for you that are now widows, concerning
what constitutes the merit of a woman, I will
sum up all in one short admonition. It will be much
for your character not to sink beneath your own actual
nature (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τῆς ὑπαρχούσης φύσεως μὴ χείροσι γένεσθαι</span>); and
to be as little talked about as possible among men,
whether for praise or for dispraise<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>.”</p>

<i>The office of the Homeric Poems in relation to that of
the early Books of Holy Scripture.</i></h2></div>

<p>Even if they are regarded in no other light than as
literary treasures, the position, both of the oldest books
among the Sacred Scriptures, and, next to them, of the
Homeric poems, is so remarkable, as not only to invite,
but to command the attention of every inquirer
into the early condition of mankind. Each of them
opens to us a scene, of which we have no other literary
knowledge. Each of them is, either wholly or in a great
degree, isolated; and cut off from the domain of history,
as it is commonly understood. Each of them was preserved
with the most jealous care by the nation to which
they severally belonged. By far the oldest of known compositions,
and with conclusive proof upon the face of
them that their respective origins were perfectly distinct
and independent, they, notwithstanding, seem to be in no
point contradictory, while in many they are highly confirmatory
of each other’s genuineness and antiquity. Still,
as historical representations, and in a purely human
aspect, they are greatly different. The Holy Scriptures
are like a thin stream, beginning from the very fountain-head
of our race, and gradually, but continuously finding
their way through an extended solitude, into times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
otherwise known, and into the general current of the
fortunes of mankind. The Homeric poems are like a
broad lake outstretched in the distance, which provides
us with a mirror of one particular age and people, alike
full and marvellous, but which is entirely dissociated
by an interval of many generations from any other records,
except such as are of the most partial and fragmentary
kind. In respect of the influence which they
have respectively exercised upon mankind, it might appear
almost profane to compare them. In this point of
view, the Scriptures stand so far apart from every other
production, on account of their great offices in relation
to the coming of the Redeemer, and to the spiritual
training of mankind, that there can be nothing either
like or second to them.</p>

<p>But undoubtedly, after however wide an interval,
the Homeric poems thus far at least stand in a certain
relation to the Scriptures, that no other work of man
can be compared to them. Their immediate influence
has been great; but that influence which they have
mediately exercised through their share in shaping the
mind and nationality of Greece, and again, through
Greece upon the world, cannot readily be reduced to
measure: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les vraies origines de l’esprit humain sont là;
tous les nobles de l’intelligence y retrouvent la patrie de
leurs pères</i><a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a>. Insomuch that, passing over the vast interval
between those purposes which concern salvation,
and every other purpose connected with man, this remains
to be admitted, that there is a relative parallelism
between the oldest Holy Scriptures and the works of
Homer. For each of them stands at the head of the
class of powers to which they respectively belong; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
the minor seems to present to our view, as well as the
major one, the indications of a distinct Providential
aim that was to be attained through its means.</p>

<p>The relation, however, of the Homeric poems to the
earlier portion of the Sacred Scriptures, appears to me
to be capable of being represented in a more determinate
form than it assumes when they are merely compared
as being respectively the oldest known compositions,
and as each confirming the testimony of the
other by numerous coincidences of manners.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Providential functions of Greece and Rome.</i></div>

<p>For the Eastern world, it is, I suppose, generally
acknowledged that we ought to regard Mahometanism
as having had, no less than Judaism, a place,
though doubtless a very different place, in the determinate
counsels of God. So in the West, we must
view the extraordinary developments, which human
nature received, both individually and in its social
forms, among the Greeks and Romans, as having been
intended to fulfil high Providential purposes. They supplied
materials for the intellectual and social portions of
that European civilization, which derives its spiritual substance
from the Christian Faith. And they wrought out
solutions apparently conclusive for the questions which
absolutely required an answer, as to the capacity or incapacity
of man, when without the aid of especial divine
light and guidance, to work out his own happiness and
peace. That Divine Word, which tells us that the
Redeemer came in the fulness of time, indirectly points
to the great transactions which filled the space of ages
since the Fall, when time was not yet full; and the
greatest of all those great transactions surely were the
parts played by Greece and Rome, as the representatives
of humanity at large in its most vigorous developments.
They too, as well as the discipline of the Jewish people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
doubtless belonged to the Divine plan. All these varied
manifestations may differ much in their character
and rank, but yet, like the body, soul, and spirit of a
man, they are to be referred to one origin, and they
are integrants to one another.</p>

<p>Just in the same manner with the parallel currents
of historical events, it would appear that the early
Scriptures and the Homeric poems combine to make
up for us a sufficiently complete form of the primitive
records of our race. The Scriptures of the Old Testament
give us the history of the line, in which the promise
of the Messiah was handed down. But the intellectual
and social developments of man are there represented
in the simplest and the slightest, nay, even in
the narrowest forms. With the exception of Solomon,
who, in spite of his wisdom, was enticed away from
God by lust, and of the two illustrious specimens of
uncorrupted piety in the midst of dangerous power,
Joseph and Daniel, I know not whether we can, on the
authority of Holy Scripture, point to any character of
the Mosaic or Judaic history as great in any other
sense, than as the organs of that Almighty One, with
whom nothing human is either great or small. It is plain
that if we bring the leading characters of that history
into contrast with the Achilles or the Ulysses of Homer,
and with his other marked personages, these latter undoubtedly
give us a representation and development of
human nature, and of man in his social relations, that
Scripture from its very nature could not supply. Each
has its own function to perform, so that there is no
room for competition between them, and it is better to
avoid comparison altogether; and to decline to consider
the legislation of Moses as a work to be compared
either with the heroic institutions, or with systems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
like those of Lycurgus or of Solon. We then obtain a
clear view of it as a scheme evidently constructed not
alone with human but with superhuman wisdom, if
only we measure it in reference to its very peculiar end.
That end was not to give political lessons to mankind,
which are more aptly supplied elsewhere. It was to
fence in, with the ruder materials of the ceremonial
and municipal law, a home, within which the succession
of true piety and enlightened faith might be preserved;
a garden wherein the Lord God might, so to speak,
still walk as He had walked of old, and take His delight
with the sons of men. But this high calling had reference
only to chosen persons, a few among the few. Over
and above this interior work, there was a national vocation
also. The aim of that vocation seems to have been
to isolate the people, so as to stop the influences from
without that might tend in the direction of change; and
so far to crystallize, as it were, its institutions within,
that they might preserve in untainted purity the tradition
and the expectation of Him that was to come.</p>

<p>When the Almighty placed his seal upon Abraham
by the covenant of circumcision, and when He developed
that covenant in the Mosaic institutions, in
setting the Jewish people apart for a purpose the most
profound of all His wise designs, He removed it, for
the time of its career, out of the family of nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sacred Books not mere literary records.</i></div>

<p>Should we, like some writers of the present day, cite
the Pentateuch before the tribunal of the mere literary
critic, we may strain our generosity at the cost of justice,
and still only be able to accord to it a secondary place.
The mistake surely is to bring it there at all, or to view
its author otherwise than as the vehicle of a Divine
purpose, which uses all instruments, great, insignificant,
or middling, according to the end in view, but of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
all the instruments are perfect, by reason not of what
is intrinsic to themselves, but, simply and solely, of
their exact adaptation to that end<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a>.</p>

<p>If, however, we ought to decline to try the Judaic
code by its merely political merits, much more ought
we to apply the same principle to the sublimity of the
Prophecies, and to the deep spiritual experiences of the
Psalms. In the first, we have a voice speaking from
God, with the marks that it is of God so visibly imprinted
upon it, that the mind utterly refuses to place
the prophetical books in the scale against any production
of human genius. And all that is peculiar in our conception
of Isaiah, or of Jeremiah, does not tend so
much to make them eminent among men, as to separate
them from men. Homer, on the other hand, is emphatically
and above all things human: he sings by the
spontaneous and the unconscious indwelling energies
of nature; whereas these are as the trumpet of unearthly
sounds, and cannot, more than Balaam could,
depart from that which is breathed into them, to utter
either less or more.</p>

<p>But most of all does the Book of Psalms refuse the
challenge of philosophical or poetical competition. In
that Book, for well nigh three thousand years, the piety
of saints has found its most refined and choicest food;
to such a degree indeed, that the rank and quality of
the religious frame may in general be tested, at least ne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>gatively,
by the height of its relish for them. There is
the whole music of the human heart, when touched by
the hand of the Maker, in all its tones that whisper or
that swell, for every hope and fear, for every joy and
pang, for every form of strength and languor, of disquietude
and rest. There are developed all the innermost
relations of the human soul to God, built upon the
platform of a covenant of love and sonship that had its
foundations in the Messiah, while in this particular and
privileged Book it was permitted to anticipate His
coming.</p>

<p>We can no more then compare Isaiah and the Psalms
with Homer, than we can compare David’s heroism with
Diomed’s, or the prowess of the Israelites when they
drove Philistia before them with the valour of the Greeks
at Marathon or Platæa, at Issus or Arbela. We shall
most nearly do justice to each by observing carefully the
boundary lines of their respective provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Providential uses of the Homeric poems.</i></div>

<p>It appears to be to a certain extent agreed that
Rome has given us the most extraordinary example
among all those put upon record by history, of political
organization; and has bequeathed to mankind the firmest
and most durable tissue of law, the bond of social man.
Greece, on the other hand, has had for its share the development
of the individual; and each has shown in its
own kind the rarest specimen that has been known to the
world, apart from Divine revelation. The seeds of both
these, and of all that they involved, would appear to be
contained in the Homeric poems<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a>. The condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
arts, manners, character, and institutions, which they
represent, is alike in itself entire, and without any full
parallel elsewhere. It is for the bodily and mental
faculties of man, that which the patriarchal and early
Hebrew histories are for his spiritual life.</p>

<p>Of the personal and inward relations of man with
God, of the kingdom of grace in the world, Homer can
tell us nothing: but of the kingdom of Providence
much, and of the opening powers and capabilities of
human nature, apart from divine revelation, everything.
The moral law, written on the tables of stone, was in
one sense a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, because
it demonstrated our inability to tread the way of
righteousness and pardon without the Redeemer. And
perhaps that ceremonial law, which indulged some
things to the hardness of heart that prevailed among
the Jews, was by its permissions, as some have construed
a very remarkable passage in Ezekiel<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a>, a schoolmaster
in another sense; because it witnessed to the fact that
they had greatly fallen below the high capacities of their
nature. And again, in yet a third sense, we may say
with reverence that these primeval records are likewise
another schoolmaster, teaching us, although with another
voice, the very same lesson: because they show us the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
total inability of our race, even when at its maximum
of power, to solve for ourselves the problems of our
destiny; to extract for ourselves the sting from care,
from sorrow, and above all, from death; or even to
retain without waste the vital heat of the knowledge
of God, when we have become separate from the source
that imparts it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>They complete the code of primitive instruction.</i></div>

<p>It seems impossible not to be struck, at this point, with
the contrast between the times preceding the Advent,
and those which have followed it. Since the Advent,
Christianity has marched for fifteen hundred years at the
head of human civilization; and has driven, harnessed
to its chariot as the horses of a triumphal car, the chief
intellectual and material forces of the world. Its learning
has been the learning of the world, its art the
art of the world, its genius the genius of the world,
its greatness, glory, grandeur, and majesty have been
almost, though not absolutely, all that in these respects
the world has had to boast of. That which is to come,
I do not presume to portend: but of the past we may
speak with confidence. He who hereafter, in even the
remotest age, with the colourless impartiality of mere
intelligence, may seek to know what durable results
mankind has for the last fifteen hundred years achieved,
what capital of the mind it has accumulated and transmitted,
will find his investigations perforce concentrated
upon, and almost confined to that part, that minor part,
of mankind which has been Christian.</p>

<p>Before the Advent, it was quite otherwise. The
treasure of Divine Revelation was then hidden in a
napkin: it was given to a people who were almost forbidden
to impart it; at least of whom it was simply required,
that they should preserve it without variation.
They had no world-wide vocation committed to them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
they lay ensconced in a country which was narrow and
obscure; obscure, not only with reference to the surpassing
splendour of Greece and Rome, but in comparison
with Assyria, or Persia, or Egypt. They have not
supplied the Christian ages with laws and institutions,
arts and sciences, with the chief models of greatness
in genius or in character. The Providence of God
committed this work to others; and to Homer seems
to have been intrusted the first, which was perhaps, all
things considered, also the most remarkable stage
of it<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Christianity supplied a centre to history.</i></div>

<p>Without bearing fully in mind this contrast between
the providential function of the Jews and that of other
nations, we can hardly embrace as we ought the importance
of the part assigned, before the Advent of
our Lord, to nations and persons who lived beyond the
immediate and narrow pale of Divine Revelation. The
relation of the old dispensation to those who were not
Jews, was essentially different from that of Christendom
to those who are not Christians. Only the fall of man
and his recovery are the universal facts with which Revelation
is concerned; all others are limited and partial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
The interval between the occurrence of the first, and the
provision for the second, was occupied by a variety of
preparations in severalty for the revelation of the kingdom
of God. Until the Incarnation, the world’s history
was without a centre. When the Incarnation came,
it showed itself to be the centre of all that had preceded,
as well as of all that was to follow: and since
the withdrawal of the visible Messiah, the history of
man has been grouped around His Word, and around
the Church in which the effect and virtue of His Incarnation
are still by His unseen power prolonged.</p>

<p>The picture thus offered to our view is a very remarkable
one. We see the glories of the world, and
that greatest marvel of God’s earthly creation, the mind
of man, become like little children, and yield themselves
to be led by the hand of the Good Shepherd:
but it seems as though the ancient promise of His
coming, while just strong enough to live in this wayward
sphere, was not strong enough to make the
conquest of it; as if nothing but His own actual
manifestation in the strength of lowliness and of sorrow,
and crowned by the extremity of contempt and
shame, was sufficient to restore for the world at large
that symbol of the universal duty of individual obedience
and conformity, which is afforded by the establishment
of the authority of the spiritual King over all the
functions of our nature, and all the spheres, however
manifold and remote they may seem to be, in which
they find their exercise. Nor is this lesson the less
striking because this, like other parts of the divine
dispensations, has been marred by the perversity of
man, ever striving to escape from that inward control
wherein lies the true hope and safety of his race.</p>

<p>But, even after the Advent, it was not at once that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
the Sovereign of the new kingdom put in His claim
for all the wealth that it contained. As, in the day of
His humiliation, He rode into Jerusalem, foreshadowing
his royal dominion to come, so Saint Paul was
forthwith consecrated to God as a kind of first fruits
of the learning and intellect of man. Yet for many
generations after Christ, it was still the Supreme will
to lay in human weakness the foundations of divine
strength. Not the Apostles only, but the martyrs, and
not the martyrs only, but the first fathers and doctors
of the Church, were men of whom none could suspect
that they drew the weapons of their warfare from the
armouries of human cultivation: nor of them could it
be said, that by virtue of their human endowments
they had achieved the triumphs of the cross; as it
might perhaps have been said, had they brought to
their work the immense popular powers of St. Chrysostom,
or the masculine energy of St. Athanasius, or
the varied and comprehensive genius of St. Augustine.</p>

<p>Nor, again, if we are right in the belief that we are
not to look for the early development of humanity in
the pages of Jewish and patriarchal history, but rather
to believe that it was given to another people, and the
office of recording it to the father, not only of poetry,
but of letters, does it seem difficult to read in this arrangement
the purpose of the Most High, and herewith
the wisdom of that purpose. Had the Scriptures
been preserved, had the Messiah been Incarnate,
among a people who were in political sagacity, in
martial energy, in soaring and diving intellect, in vivid
imagination, in the graces of art and civilized life,
the flower of their time, then the divine origin of
Christianity would have stood far less clear and disem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>barrassed
than it now does. The eagle that mounted
upon high, bearing on his wings the Everlasting Gospel,
would have made his first spring from a great eminence,
erected by the wit and skill of man; and the elevation
of that eminence, measured upward from the plain of
common humanity, would have been so much to be deducted
from the triumph of the Redeemer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Purpose served by the design.</i></div>

<p>Thus the destructive theories of those, who teach us
to regard Christianity as no more than a new stage,
added to stages that had been previously achieved in
the march of human advancement, would have been
clothed in a plausibility which they must now for ever
want. ‘God hath chosen the foolish things of the world
to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak
things of the world to confound the things which are
mighty; and base things of the world, and things
which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things
which are not, to bring to nought things that are<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a>.’
An unhonoured undistinguished race, simply elected to
be the receivers of the Divine Word, and having remained
its always stiffnecked and almost reluctant
guardians, may best have suited the aim of Almighty
Wisdom; because the medium, through which the
most precious gifts were conveyed, was pale and colourless,
instead of being one flushed with the splendours
of Empire, Intellect, and Fame.</p>

to render <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πηρὸς</span> blind: but
it would be strange that this
should be meant, since blindness
is associated in the case of Demodocus
with conferring the gift
of song, which here is taken away
(Od. vii. 64). Apollodorus (i. 3. 3.)
reports that the Muses had the
power of blinding him by a previous
agreement between him and
them. The more natural construction
of the passage seems to
be such as I have ventured to
point at in the text. For blindness
did not maim Bards, who neither
wrote nor read their compositions.</p></div>

believers in revelation may justly
regard the mere literary handling
of the Older Scriptures, I
would refer to the remarkable
work of M. Ernest Renan, ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études
d’Histoire Religieuse</i>.’ This eloquent
and elastic writer treats
the idea of a revealed religion as
wholly inadmissible; highly extols
the Bible as a literary treasure;
but denies that the general
reading of the Bible is a good,
except in so far as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il vaut beaucoup
mieux voir le peuple lire la
Bible que ne rien lire</i> (pp. 75, 385).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_1015_1015" id="Footnote_1015_1015"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1015_1015"><span class="label">[1015]</span></a> In the Roman History of
Mommsen is contained a masterly
comparison between those
two rival developments of human
life, the collective and the individual,
which are represented by
Rome, and by later or historic
Greece, respectively. (Mommsen
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Röm. Gesch.</span> I. 2. pp. 18&ndash;21.)
Both of them are open
to criticism. In the one we
may notice and brand the characteristic
of an iron repression,
in the other that of a lawless
freedom. But the age which
ended with the war of Troy, and
cast the reflection of its dying
beams upon its noble but chequered
epilogue in the Odyssey,
appears to make no fundamental
deviation from the mean of wisdom
in either direction: on the
whole, it united reverence with
independence, the restraint of
discipline with the expansion of
freedom: and it stood alike removed,
in the plenitude of its
natural elasticity, from those extremes
which in modern religion
have, on the one side, absorbed
the individual, and on the other
(so to speak) excommunicated
him by isolation.</p></div>

one, I can never read without
pain the disparaging account of
the Greek mind and its achievements
which, in the Fourth Book
of the Paradise Regained, so great
a man as Milton has too boldly
put into the mouth of our Blessed
Lord. We there find our sympathies
divided, in an indescribable
and most unhappy manner,
between the person of the All-wise,
and the language and ideas,
on the whole not less just, which
are given to Satan. In particular,
I lament the claim, really no
better than a childish one, made
on the part of the Jews, to be
considered as the fountainhead of
the Greek arts and letters, and
the assumption for them of higher
attainments in political science.
This is a sacrifice of truth, reason,
and history to prejudice, by which,
as by all such proceedings, religion
is sure to be in the end the
loser.</p></div>
